Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al.

No consensus reached. | Relates to #750 (p-value computation refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #37 (Diebold-Mariano test), #1022 (two-model pairwise). | Resolve design consensus on which MCS methodology to implement (Hansen et al. on complete sets, novel incomplete-set extension, or Bayesian), then implement `get_model_confidence_set()` building on existing pairwise comparison infrastructure. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    28→| 1046 | multivariate scoring in scoring rules vignette | documentation | 2025-11-04 | documentation | low | small | partially | Open, agreed upon by maintainers. The scoring-rules vignette has zero mentions of multivariate scoring. A dedicated multivariate vignette already exists. Only a cross-reference and brief section are missing. | None. All underlying code and the dedicated multivariate vignette already exist. | Add a short section to `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd` describing the energy score for multivariate forecasts and cross-linking to the existing `scoring-multivariate-forecasts` vignette.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output. Update test snapshots. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    31→| 1026 | as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile | enhancement | 2025-07-13 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples. Requires design decision on approximation method and potential new package dependency. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    32→| 1022 | Let `get_pairwise_comparison()` run with two models? | | 2025-07-03 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    33→| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    34→| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    42→| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

The underlying concerns (code simplification, reuse of `interval_coverage_quantile`) were resolved by deleting the function and unifying the API around quantile-format coverage computation. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n   114→| 406 | Maybe expose `get_type()`. | | 2023-11-10 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `get_type()` (vector type detection: classification/integer/continuous) and `get_forecast_type()` (forecast class type) both exist in `R/get-forecast-type.R` but are internal (`@keywords internal`), not exported. The proposed renames (`get_vector_type`, `get_observed_type`, `get_predicted_type`) were never implemented. No comments, no progress. | Related to #484 (functions to expose) and #885 (export decisions). No blockers. | Rename `get_type()` to `get_vector_type()`, export it, and create `get_observed_type()` / `get_predicted_type()` wrappers that extract the relevant column from a forecast and call `get_vector_type()`.

No conversion functions for external packages (Stan, Odin, yardstick, hubverse) exist. The `as_forecast_*` S3 generic system provides extension points for external packages to write their own methods. Hubverse integration was explicitly moved to external `hubEvals` package (#605 closed). Maintainer consensus: package-specific conversions are too varied and dependency-heavy for scoringutils. Yardstick conversion code in comments never formalized. 2+ years old with no progress. | Related to #356 (interoperability vignette), #363 (external function interface), #852 (custom forecast class workflow), #983 (`.data.frame` methods), #1026 (`as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile`). | Consider narrowing scope or closing in favor of more specific issues. The broad goal is better served by: (1) completing S3 extensibility infrastructure (#852, #983, #889, #888), (2) writing an interoperability vignette (#356), and (3) possibly adding 1-2 zero-dependency convenience converters if demand warrants.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite. A commented-out test skeleton exists in `test-score.R` (lines 51-62). `apply_metrics()` silently overwrites any existing column whose name matches a metric name via `forecast[, (metric_name) := result]`.

No wrapper/adapter functions exist. Users must manually wrap external metrics with non-standard signatures (e.g., reversed arg order, numeric 0/1 instead of factor observed). Two small wrapper proposals in the issue body (`wrap_binary_numeric`, `wrap_switch_order`) were never implemented.

Metrics with non-standard I/O (many-to-one like AUC, many-to-many like PIT) cannot fit into `score()`. The PIT case is solved outside `score()` via `get_pit_histogram()`. Zero comments, no design consensus. The multivariate sample class introduced a partial precedent (multiple rows collapse into groups) but by restructuring data before `apply_metrics()`, not by changing it. 2+ years old. | Related to #455 (data frame returns — recommended for closure), #363 (wrapper functions), #338 (cross-type metrics), #941 (rethink `score()` S3), #852 (custom class workflow). | Long-term design question with no clear path forward. The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established. Consider closing as won't-fix or consolidating with #455, #363, #338 into a single milestone-level tracking issue.

The remaining question is whether individual metric functions (e.g., `bias_sample`/`bias_quantile`) should also become S3 generics for standalone use. Practical need is low since `score()` already dispatches correctly via `get_metrics.<class>`. 6 conceptual metrics span 2+ forecast types with type-suffixed names. | #832 (done). Related to #455 (vector returns), #941 (rethink `score()` S3). No blockers. | Consider downgrading from \"Breaking change\" since S3 wrappers could be additive.

Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types.

No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette.

The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile.

No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy.

No conversion functions for external packages (Stan, Odin, yardstick, hubverse) exist. The `as_forecast_*` S3 generic system provides extension points for external packages to write their own methods. Hubverse integration was explicitly moved to external `hubEvals` package (#605 closed). Maintainer consensus: package-specific conversions are too varied and dependency-heavy for scoringutils.

The broad goal is better served by: (1) completing S3 extensibility infrastructure (#852, #983, #889, #888), (2) writing an interoperability vignette (#356), and (3) possibly adding 1-2 zero-dependency convenience converters if demand warrants.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite. A commented-out test skeleton exists in `test-score.R` (lines 51-62). `apply_metrics()` silently overwrites any existing column whose name matches a metric name via `forecast[, (metric_name) := result]`.

No wrapper/adapter functions exist. Users must manually wrap external metrics with non-standard signatures (e.g., reversed arg order, numeric 0/1 instead of factor observed). Two small wrapper proposals in the issue body (`wrap_binary_numeric`, `wrap_switch_order`) were never implemented. The `purrr::partial()` mechanism alone cannot solve argument reordering or type conversion.

Metrics with non-standard I/O (many-to-one like AUC, many-to-many like PIT) cannot fit into `score()`. The PIT case is solved outside `score()` via `get_pit_histogram()`. Zero comments, no design consensus. The multivariate sample class introduced a partial precedent (multiple rows collapse into groups) but by restructuring data before `apply_metrics()`, not by changing it. 2+ years old. | Related to #455 (data frame returns — recommended for closure), #363 (wrapper functions), #338 (cross-type metrics), #941 (rethink `score()` S3), #852 (custom class workflow). | Long-term design question with no clear path forward. The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established. Consider closing as won't-fix or consolidating with #455, #363, #338 into a single milestone-level tracking issue.

Consensus reached on MVP: add a warning when `get_type(predicted) == \"integer\"`. Discussion also suggested possibly removing `log_score` from default metrics for sample forecasts. | None. All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

The remaining question is whether individual metric functions (e.g., `bias_sample`/`bias_quantile`) should also become S3 generics for standalone use.

Related to #455 (vector returns), #941 (rethink `score()` S3). No blockers. | Consider downgrading from \"Breaking change\" since S3 wrappers could be additive. If pursued, create `bias()`, `overprediction()`, `underprediction()`, `dispersion()`, `ae_median()`, `logs()` as S3 generics dispatching on forecast class, keeping suffixed functions as implementations.

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature). If yes, run `usethis::use_release_issue()` and proceed with CRAN submission. If not, close the issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1064 | Pre-ranking for multivariate calibration assessment | | 2026-01-30 | feature | medium | large | no | No pre-ranking or multivariate calibration diagnostics exist in the codebase. The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al. (2008) as calibration diagnostics for multivariate forecasts, after resolving the API design choice with maintainers. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1057 | Revise README to remove news about the package rewrite | documentation | 2026-01-29 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Open, no assignee. The rewrite messaging and Google Drive paper links appear in 4 locations in README.Rmd. Mechanical edits are straightforward but replacement text requires editorial decisions about where to point users for documentation. | Loosely related to #810 (pkgdown for dev docs) and #759 (future of scoringutils.Rmd vignette). | Edit `README.Rmd` to remove/soften the \"major re-write\" paragraph and replace Google Drive paper links with pointers to package vignettes/docs, then re-render README.md. Confirm preferred documentation hierarchy with maintainers first. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1055 | Model confidence sets | feature request | 2026-01-19 | feature | medium | large | no | Design phase — methodology not yet agreed upon. 6 comments with active debate. Naive pairwise p-value approach acknowledged as incomplete. Three alternatives discussed: Hansen et al. MCS, novel extension for incomplete sets, Bayesian approach. No consensus reached. | Relates to #750 (p-value computation refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #37 (Diebold-Mariano test), #1022 (two-model pairwise). | Resolve design consensus on which MCS methodology to implement (Hansen et al. on complete sets, novel incomplete-set extension, or Bayesian), then implement `get_model_confidence_set()` building on existing pairwise comparison infrastructure. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1046 | multivariate scoring in scoring rules vignette | documentation | 2025-11-04 | documentation | low | small | partially | Open, agreed upon by maintainers. The scoring-rules vignette has zero mentions of multivariate scoring. A dedicated multivariate vignette already exists. Only a cross-reference and brief section are missing. | None. All underlying code and the dedicated multivariate vignette already exist. | Add a short section to `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd` describing the energy score for multivariate forecasts and cross-linking to the existing `scoring-multivariate-forecasts` vignette. No code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1044 | Remove the commented out vignette code. | | 2025-09-23 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Two HTML comment blocks remain: a WIP \"Details on the grouping\" section in `scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` (lines 88-102) and a ~50-line PIT/Calibration section in `scoring-rules.Rmd` (lines 444-493). Originated from PR #998 review comment. | None. | Delete the two HTML-commented-out code blocks from `vignettes/scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` and `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd`. Optionally confirm with maintainers whether the PIT/Calibration text should be preserved elsewhere. | N/A | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1043 | Update print method for multivariate forecasts to show `joint_across` | | 2025-09-21 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output. Update test snapshots. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1026 | as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile | enhancement | 2025-07-13 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples. Requires design decision on approximation method and potential new package dependency. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1022 | Let `get_pairwise_comparison()` run with two models? | | 2025-07-03 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Issue #758 contains a detailed draft vignette stub (\"Choosing a scoring rule\") that already references this PNG with prose.

A deleted stub vignette (`Choosing-a-score.Rmd`) once referenced it. Author expressed uncertainty (\"maybe we don't want it anymore\").

Unlike siblings (#930, #933, #934), the calibration/sharpness PNG does **not** exist in the repo — it was never generated. Code to create it is in the issue body.
