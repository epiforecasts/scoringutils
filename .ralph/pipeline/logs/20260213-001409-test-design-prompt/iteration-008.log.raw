Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error.

Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site.

WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs.

Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

Consensus reached on MVP: add a warning when `get_type(predicted) == \"integer\"`. Discussion also suggested possibly removing `log_score` from default metrics for sample forecasts. | None. All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

Consider batching with #839.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant. `check_columns_present` (and `test_columns_present`) are internal functions with 10 call sites across 9 files. All can be replaced by `checkmate::assert_subset`/`check_subset`/`test_subset` (already a dependency). One call site in `pairwise-comparisons.R:142` uses a custom error message and needs slightly different handling. No user-facing API impact.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-check-input-helpers.R` (existing, modified) + existing test files for call sites\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat with data.table fixtures; `example_quantile`, `example_binary`, `example_sample_continuous` etc. provided by scoringutils; `setup.R` pre-computes score objects; `expect_error()` with fixed string matching for assertion messages; `checkmate::assert()` wraps check functions.\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nThe fix replaces `check_columns_present(data, columns)` with `checkmate::check_subset(columns, colnames(data))` (and similarly `test_columns_present` with `checkmate::test_subset`, `assert(check_columns_present(...))` with `assert_subset(...)`). Note the **argument order reversal**: `check_columns_present(data, columns)` becomes `check_subset(columns, choices)` where `choices = colnames(data)`.\n\nThe error message format changes from:\n- `\"Column 'X' not found in data\"` / `\"Columns 'X', 'Y' not found in data\"`\nto:\n- `\"Must be a subset of {'a','b',...}, but has additional elements {'X','Y'}\"` (checkmate's format)\n\n### Call sites (10 `check_columns_present` + 1 `test_columns_present`):\n\n1. `R/class-forecast.R:115` — `assert(check_columns_present(data, c(\"observed\", \"predicted\")))` → `assert_subset(c(\"observed\", \"predicted\"), colnames(data))`\n2. `R/class-forecast.R:116` — `test_columns_present(data, c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\"))` → `test_subset(c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\"), colnames(data))`\n3. `R/class-forecast-sample.R:62` — `assert(check_columns_present(forecast, \"sample_id\"))` → `assert_subset(\"sample_id\", colnames(forecast))`\n4. `R/class-forecast-quantile.R:84` — `assert(check_columns_present(forecast, \"quantile_level\"))` → `assert_subset(\"quantile_level\", colnames(forecast))`\n5. `R/class-forecast-nominal.R:78` — `assert(check_columns_present(forecast, \"predicted_label\"))` → `assert_subset(\"predicted_label\", colnames(forecast))`\n6. `R/class-forecast-ordinal.R:78` — `assert(check_columns_present(forecast, \"predicted_label\"))` → `assert_subset(\"predicted_label\", colnames(forecast))`\n7. `R/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R:87` — `assert(check_columns_present(forecast, c(\"sample_id\", \".mv_group_id\")))` → `assert_subset(c(\"sample_id\", \".mv_group_id\"), colnames(forecast))`\n8. `R/pairwise-comparisons.R:127` — `assert(check_columns_present(scores, compare))` → `assert_subset(compare, colnames(scores))`\n9. `R/pairwise-comparisons.R:142` — `by_cols <- check_columns_present(scores, by)` used in custom error → `by_cols <- check_subset(by, colnames(scores))`\n10. `R/plot-wis.R:53` — `assert(check_columns_present(scores, wis_components))` → `assert_subset(wis_components, colnames(scores))`\n11. `R/get-correlations.R:88` — `col_present <- check_columns_present(correlations, \"metric\")` used as boolean check → `col_present <- check_subset(\"metric\", colnames(correlations))`\n\n---\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"check_columns_present and test_columns_present are removed\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Confirms the functions have been deleted\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-check-input-helpers.R`\n**Setup**:\n- No special setup needed\n**Action**:\n- Attempt to call `scoringutils:::check_columns_present(example_binary, \"location_name\")` and `scoringutils:::test_columns_present(example_binary, \"location_name\")`\n**Expected**:\n- Both calls should error (function not found), OR the existing tests that directly call `check_columns_present` should be entirely removed from `test-check-input-helpers.R` (lines 14-56 in current file)\n**Fails now because**:\n- The functions currently exist, so direct calls succeed. After deletion, the old test blocks (lines 14-56) must be removed.\n\n**Implementation note**: The existing test blocks at lines 14-36 (`\"check_columns_present works\"`) and lines 48-56 (`\"check_columns_present() works\"`) should be deleted entirely. The `test_columns_not_present` test block (lines 39-46) should also be deleted if #839 is batched, but if not batched, it should remain.\n\n---\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"assert_forecast_generic errors when 'observed' or 'predicted' columns are missing\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Validates that the replacement at `R/class-forecast.R:115` still produces an error when required columns are missing\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast.R` (existing — likely already has this test, but error message expectations need updating)\n**Setup**:\n- Create a minimal data.table with no `observed` or `predicted` columns, e.g. `data.table(x = 1:3, y = 4:6)`\n**Action**:\n- Call `as_forecast_binary(data)` (or any `as_forecast_*` that goes through `assert_forecast_generic`)\n**Expected**:\n- Should error. The error message will change from containing `\"not found in data\"` to checkmate's `\"Must be a subset of\"` / `\"additional elements\"` format. Test should use a pattern that matches the new message.\n**Fails now because**:\n- Currently produces error with `\"Column 'observed' not found in data\"`. After the fix, will produce a `checkmate::assert_subset` error like `\"Must be a subset of {'x','y'}, but has additional elements {'observed','predicted'}\"`.\n\n---\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"assert_forecast_generic detects both sample_id and quantile_level columns\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Validates the `test_columns_present` → `test_subset` replacement at `R/class-forecast.R:116`\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast.R` (existing)\n**Setup**:\n- Create a data.table with both `sample_id` and `quantile_level` columns present alongside `observed` and `predicted`\n**Action**:\n- Call `as_forecast_sample(data)` or `as_forecast_quantile(data)` — the generic assertion should catch the conflict\n**Expected**:\n- Should error with message about both `quantile_level` and `sample_id` being present (this error message is from `cli_abort`, not from `check_columns_present`, so it should be unchanged)\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS both before and after the fix — it is a regression test ensuring the `test_subset` replacement doesn't break this detection logic. The underlying error message comes from `cli_abort` and is independent of the column-checking function used.\n\n---\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"assert_forecast.forecast_sample errors when sample_id is missing\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Validates replacement at `R/class-forecast-sample.R:62`\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-sample.R` (existing)\n**Setup**:\n- Take `example_sample_continuous`, remove the `sample_id` column\n**Action**:\n- Call `as_forecast_sample(data)`\n**Expected**:\n- Should error. After fix, error message changes to checkmate's `assert_subset` format (e.g., `\"Must be a subset of {colnames}, but has additional elements {'sample_id'}\"`)\n**Fails now because**:\n- Currently produces `\"Column 'sample_id' not found in data\"`. After replacement with `assert_subset`, the error format changes.

Consider batching with #839.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant. `check_columns_present` (and `test_columns_present`) are internal functions with 10 call sites across 9 files. All can be replaced by `checkmate::assert_subset`/`check_subset`/`test_subset` (already a dependency). One call site in `pairwise-comparisons.R:142` uses a custom error message and needs slightly different handling. No user-facing API impact.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-check-input-helpers.R` (existing, modified) + existing test files for call sites\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat with data.table fixtures; `example_quantile`, `example_binary`, `example_sample_continuous` etc. provided by scoringutils; `setup.R` pre-computes score objects; `expect_error()` with fixed string matching for assertion messages; `checkmate::assert()` wraps check functions.\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nThe fix replaces `check_columns_present(data, columns)` with `checkmate::check_subset(columns, colnames(data))` (and similarly `test_columns_present` with `checkmate::test_subset`, `assert(check_columns_present(...))` with `assert_subset(...)`). Note the **argument order reversal**: `check_columns_present(data, columns)` becomes `check_subset(columns, choices)` where `choices = colnames(data)`.\n\nThe error message format changes from:\n- `\"Column 'X' not found in data\"` / `\"Columns 'X', 'Y' not found in data\"`\nto:\n- `\"Must be a subset of {'a','b',...}, but has additional elements {'X','Y'}\"` (checkmate's format)\n\n### Call sites (10 `check_columns_present` + 1 `test_columns_present`):\n\n1. `R/class-forecast.R:115` — `assert(check_columns_present(data, c(\"observed\", \"predicted\")))` → `assert_subset(c(\"observed\", \"predicted\"), colnames(data))`\n2. `R/class-forecast.R:116` — `test_columns_present(data, c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\"))` → `test_subset(c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\"), colnames(data))`\n3. `R/class-forecast-sample.R:62` — `assert(check_columns_present(forecast, \"sample_id\"))` → `assert_subset(\"sample_id\", colnames(forecast))`\n4. `R/class-forecast-quantile.R:84` — `assert(check_columns_present(forecast, \"quantile_level\"))` → `assert_subset(\"quantile_level\", colnames(forecast))`\n5. `R/class-forecast-nominal.R:78` — `assert(check_columns_present(forecast, \"predicted_label\"))` → `assert_subset(\"predicted_label\", colnames(forecast))`\n6. `R/class-forecast-ordinal.R:78` — `assert(check_columns_present(forecast, \"predicted_label\"))` → `assert_subset(\"predicted_label\", colnames(forecast))`\n7. `R/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R:87` — `assert(check_columns_present(forecast, c(\"sample_id\", \".mv_group_id\")))` → `assert_subset(c(\"sample_id\", \".mv_group_id\"), colnames(forecast))`\n8. `R/pairwise-comparisons.R:127` — `assert(check_columns_present(scores, compare))` → `assert_subset(compare, colnames(scores))`\n9. `R/pairwise-comparisons.R:142` — `by_cols <- check_columns_present(scores, by)` used in custom error → `by_cols <- check_subset(by, colnames(scores))`\n10. `R/plot-wis.R:53` — `assert(check_columns_present(scores, wis_components))` → `assert_subset(wis_components, colnames(scores))`\n11. `R/get-correlations.R:88` — `col_present <- check_columns_present(correlations, \"metric\")` used as boolean check → `col_present <- check_subset(\"metric\", colnames(correlations))`\n\n---\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"check_columns_present and test_columns_present are removed\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Confirms the functions have been deleted\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-check-input-helpers.R`\n**Setup**:\n- No special setup needed\n**Action**:\n- Attempt to call `scoringutils:::check_columns_present(example_binary, \"location_name\")` and `scoringutils:::test_columns_present(example_binary, \"location_name\")`\n**Expected**:\n- Both calls should error (function not found), OR the existing tests that directly call `check_columns_present` should be entirely removed from `test-check-input-helpers.R` (lines 14-56 in current file)\n**Fails now because**:\n- The functions currently exist, so direct calls succeed. After deletion, the old test blocks (lines 14-56) must be removed.\n\n**Implementation note**: The existing test blocks at lines 14-36 (`\"check_columns_present works\"`) and lines 48-56 (`\"check_columns_present() works\"`) should be deleted entirely. The `test_columns_not_present` test block (lines 39-46) should also be deleted if #839 is batched, but if not batched, it should remain.\n\n---\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"assert_forecast_generic errors when 'observed' or 'predicted' columns are missing\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Validates that the replacement at `R/class-forecast.R:115` still produces an error when required columns are missing\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast.R` (existing — likely already has this test, but error message expectations need updating)\n**Setup**:\n- Create a minimal data.table with no `observed` or `predicted` columns, e.g. `data.table(x = 1:3, y = 4:6)`\n**Action**:\n- Call `as_forecast_binary(data)` (or any `as_forecast_*` that goes through `assert_forecast_generic`)\n**Expected**:\n- Should error. The error message will change from containing `\"not found in data\"` to checkmate's `\"Must be a subset of\"` / `\"additional elements\"` format.

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature). If yes, run `usethis::use_release_issue()` and proceed with CRAN submission. If not, close the issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1064 | Pre-ranking for multivariate calibration assessment | | 2026-01-30 | feature | medium | large | no | No pre-ranking or multivariate calibration diagnostics exist in the codebase. The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case.

Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.
