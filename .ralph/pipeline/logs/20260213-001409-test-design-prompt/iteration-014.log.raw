Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    33→| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    34→| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    42→| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

Handle `object_usage_linter` suppressions separately.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant. ~43 `#nolint start: keyword_quote_linter` blocks across R/ wrap `cli_abort()`/`cli_warn()`/`cli_inform()` calls that use `\"!\" =`, `\"i\" =` named vector syntax. Only 12 instances use Hugo's backtick fix (`` `!` = ``). The fix is mechanical: replace `\"!\" =` with `` `!` = `` inside cli condition calls, then remove the `nolint` annotations. Additional `object_usage_linter` suppressions (14 blocks) exist for `.data[...]` patterns in data.table code — these need separate handling.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-cli-linting.R` (new)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat + data.table fixtures. Helpers in `setup.R`. Pre-computed scores objects. Tests use `test_that()` with descriptive names. No existing lint-related test file. CI runs `lintr::lint_package()` on changed files via GitHub Actions.\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"no R source files use double-quoted cli condition names\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core problem — `\"!\" =`, `\"i\" =`, `\"x\" =`, `\"v\" =` patterns in cli calls trigger `keyword_quote_linter` and require `#nolint` suppressions\n**Setup**:\n- List all `.R` files in `R/` directory\n- Read each file's contents as text\n**Action**:\n- Search all R source files for the regex pattern `\"[!ixv]\"\\s*=` inside `c()` calls that are arguments to `cli_abort`, `cli_warn`, or `cli_inform`\n- More practically: grep for lines matching the pattern `\"[!ixv]\"\\s*=` across all `R/*.R` files\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_length(matches, 0)` — zero matches found. All cli condition names should use backtick quoting (`` `!` = ``, `` `i` = ``, etc.)\n**Fails now because**:\n- 53 occurrences of double-quoted cli condition names (`\"!\" =`, `\"i\" =`, `\"x\" =`, `\"v\" =`) exist across 13 R files\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"no keyword_quote_linter nolint annotations remain in R source\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the symptom — `#nolint` blocks are used to suppress `keyword_quote_linter` warnings\n**Setup**:\n- List all `.R` files in `R/` directory\n- Read each file's contents as text\n**Action**:\n- Search all R source files for lines containing `keyword_quote_linter` in `#nolint` or `# nolint` annotations\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_length(matches, 0)` — zero `keyword_quote_linter` nolint annotations remain. All such blocks should have been removed (or simplified to only mention other linters like `object_usage_linter` where those are still needed).\n**Fails now because**:\n- ~28 `#nolint start: keyword_quote_linter` / `#nolint end` blocks exist across R/ files, many also mentioning `object_usage_linter` and `duplicate_argument_linter`\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"keyword_quote_linter is not disabled in .lintr config\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the root cause configuration that allowed the bad pattern to accumulate\n**Setup**:\n- Read the `.lintr` configuration file\n**Action**:\n- Parse or search the `.lintr` file contents for `keyword_quote_linter = NULL` (which disables the linter)\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_false(any(grepl(\"keyword_quote_linter\\\\s*=\\\\s*NULL\", lintr_content)))` — the linter is no longer disabled, meaning `keyword_quote_linter` will run and catch any regressions\n**Fails now because**:\n- `.lintr` line 18 contains `keyword_quote_linter = NULL`, explicitly disabling this linter\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"cli error and warning messages still render correctly after quoting change\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: regression guard — ensures the backtick-quoting change doesn't alter cli message behavior\n**Setup**:\n- Use existing test data (e.g., `example_quantile`, `example_binary`)\n**Action**:\n- Trigger a representative cli error by calling `assert_forecast.default(data.frame())` — this exercises the backtick-quoted `!` and `i` condition names\n- Trigger another cli error by calling `as_forecast_quantile()` with data containing both `sample_id` and `quantile_level` columns — this exercises the error in `assert_forecast_generic()`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_error(assert_forecast(data.frame()), \"valid forecast object\")` — the error message content is unchanged\n- `expect_error(...)` with the appropriate message for the dual-column case — the error message content is unchanged\n- Both `\"!\"` (error bullet) and `\"i\"` (info bullet) formatting elements render identically whether using `\"!\" =` or `` `!` = `` syntax\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS both before and after the fix (it's a regression guard).

Handle `object_usage_linter` suppressions separately.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant. ~43 `#nolint start: keyword_quote_linter` blocks across R/ wrap `cli_abort()`/`cli_warn()`/`cli_inform()` calls that use `\"!\" =`, `\"i\" =` named vector syntax. Only 12 instances use Hugo's backtick fix (`` `!` = ``). The fix is mechanical: replace `\"!\" =` with `` `!` = `` inside cli condition calls, then remove the `nolint` annotations. Additional `object_usage_linter` suppressions (14 blocks) exist for `.data[...]` patterns in data.table code — these need separate handling.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-cli-linting.R` (new)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat + data.table fixtures. Helpers in `setup.R`. Pre-computed scores objects. Tests use `test_that()` with descriptive names. No existing lint-related test file. CI runs `lintr::lint_package()` on changed files via GitHub Actions.\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"no R source files use double-quoted cli condition names\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core problem — `\"!\" =`, `\"i\" =`, `\"x\" =`, `\"v\" =` patterns in cli calls trigger `keyword_quote_linter` and require `#nolint` suppressions\n**Setup**:\n- List all `.R` files in `R/` directory\n- Read each file's contents as text\n**Action**:\n- Search all R source files for the regex pattern `\"[!ixv]\"\\s*=` inside `c()` calls that are arguments to `cli_abort`, `cli_warn`, or `cli_inform`\n- More practically: grep for lines matching the pattern `\"[!ixv]\"\\s*=` across all `R/*.R` files\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_length(matches, 0)` — zero matches found. All cli condition names should use backtick quoting (`` `!` = ``, `` `i` = ``, etc.)\n**Fails now because**:\n- 53 occurrences of double-quoted cli condition names (`\"!\" =`, `\"i\" =`, `\"x\" =`, `\"v\" =`) exist across 13 R files\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"no keyword_quote_linter nolint annotations remain in R source\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the symptom — `#nolint` blocks are used to suppress `keyword_quote_linter` warnings\n**Setup**:\n- List all `.R` files in `R/` directory\n- Read each file's contents as text\n**Action**:\n- Search all R source files for lines containing `keyword_quote_linter` in `#nolint` or `# nolint` annotations\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_length(matches, 0)` — zero `keyword_quote_linter` nolint annotations remain. All such blocks should have been removed (or simplified to only mention other linters like `object_usage_linter` where those are still needed).\n**Fails now because**:\n- ~28 `#nolint start: keyword_quote_linter` / `#nolint end` blocks exist across R/ files, many also mentioning `object_usage_linter` and `duplicate_argument_linter`\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"keyword_quote_linter is not disabled in .lintr config\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the root cause configuration that allowed the bad pattern to accumulate\n**Setup**:\n- Read the `.lintr` configuration file\n**Action**:\n- Parse or search the `.lintr` file contents for `keyword_quote_linter = NULL` (which disables the linter)\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_false(any(grepl(\"keyword_quote_linter\\\\s*=\\\\s*NULL\", lintr_content)))` — the linter is no longer disabled, meaning `keyword_quote_linter` will run and catch any regressions\n**Fails now because**:\n- `.lintr` line 18 contains `keyword_quote_linter = NULL`, explicitly disabling this linter\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"cli error and warning messages still render correctly after quoting change\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: regression guard — ensures the backtick-quoting change doesn't alter cli message behavior\n**Setup**:\n- Use existing test data (e.g., `example_quantile`, `example_binary`)\n**Action**:\n- Trigger a representative cli error by calling `assert_forecast.default(data.frame())` — this exercises the backtick-quoted `!` and `i` condition names\n- Trigger another cli error by calling `as_forecast_quantile()` with data containing both `sample_id` and `quantile_level` columns — this exercises the error in `assert_forecast_generic()`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_error(assert_forecast(data.frame()), \"valid forecast object\")` — the error message content is unchanged\n- `expect_error(...)` with the appropriate message for the dual-column case — the error message content is unchanged\n- Both `\"!\"` (error bullet) and `\"i\"` (info bullet) formatting elements render identically whether using `\"!\" =` or `` `!` = `` syntax\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS both before and after the fix (it's a regression guard). The backtick-quoting change is purely syntactic — cli treats `\"!\" =` and `` `!` = `` identically. This test ensures nothing breaks during the migration.\n\n### Test 5: test_that(\"nolint blocks with only keyword_quote_linter are fully removed\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: ensures cleanup is complete — no orphaned `#nolint end` blocks or unnecessary remaining suppressions\n**Setup**:\n- List all `.R` files in `R/` directory\n- Read each file's contents\n**Action**:\n- Count `#nolint start` and `#nolint end` annotations across all R source files\n- Compare with expected count (blocks that legitimately suppress `object_usage_linter` or `duplicate_argument_linter` should remain)\n**Expected**:\n- Every remaining `#nolint start` block should mention a linter other than `keyword_quote_linter` (e.g., `object_usage_linter`, `duplicate_argument_linter`)\n- No `#nolint start` block should mention ONLY `keyword_quote_linter`\n- The count of `#nolint start` blocks should be strictly less than the pre-fix count (~28), matching only the blocks that suppress other linters\n**Fails now because**:\n- Many `#nolint start` blocks exist solely to suppress `keyword_quote_linter`, and would be entirely unnecessary after the quoting fix.

The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking.

Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist.

No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy.

On `scoringutils-2.x` milestone. | Related to #546 (vignette restructuring — decides where customization docs go), #666 (manuscript update). | Create a vignette section (or standalone vignette) walking users through the full metric customization workflow: `get_metrics()`, `select_metrics()`, `purrr::partial()`, custom metric functions, and passing to `score()`.
