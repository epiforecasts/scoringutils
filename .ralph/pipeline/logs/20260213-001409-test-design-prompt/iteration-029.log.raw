Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error.

Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site.

WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs.

Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

No conversion functions for external packages (Stan, Odin, yardstick, hubverse) exist. The `as_forecast_*` S3 generic system provides extension points for external packages to write their own methods. Hubverse integration was explicitly moved to external `hubEvals` package (#605 closed). Maintainer consensus: package-specific conversions are too varied and dependency-heavy for scoringutils.

The broad goal is better served by: (1) completing S3 extensibility infrastructure (#852, #983, #889, #888), (2) writing an interoperability vignette (#356), and (3) possibly adding 1-2 zero-dependency convenience converters if demand warrants.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite. A commented-out test skeleton exists in `test-score.R` (lines 51-62). `apply_metrics()` silently overwrites any existing column whose name matches a metric name via `forecast[, (metric_name) := result]`.

Metrics with non-standard I/O (many-to-one like AUC, many-to-many like PIT) cannot fit into `score()`. The PIT case is solved outside `score()` via `get_pit_histogram()`. Zero comments, no design consensus.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

Consensus reached on MVP: add a warning when `get_type(predicted) == \"integer\"`. Discussion also suggested possibly removing `log_score` from default metrics for sample forecasts. | None. All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

The remaining question is whether individual metric functions (e.g., `bias_sample`/`bias_quantile`) should also become S3 generics for standalone use.

Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me compile my findings into a thorough report.\n\n---\n\n## Comprehensive Test Landscape Report for `score()` Function Changes\n\n### 1. Test File Structure: `tests/testthat/test-score.R`\n\n**Lines 40-70 Analysis:**\nLines 40-70 of `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/test-score.R` contain:\n- **Lines 40-41**: Section header comment for `score()` tests\n- **Lines 44-49**: Test that `score()` throws error for non-forecast objects\n- **Lines 51-58**: Test for manipulating scores objects with `[` operator (data.table subsetting)\n- **Lines 62-84**: Test for continuous forecast format scoring\n\n**Important Note**: There is **NO commented-out test skeleton** for metric/column name clash detection in lines 40-70. The user's description appears to be mistaken or refers to a different issue. However, Ralph's issue #811 (batch failed metric warnings) does exist and has detailed test specifications.\n\n### 2. Test Helper Files & Setup\n\n**`tests/testthat/setup.R`** (6 lines total):\n```r\ndata.table::setDTthreads(2)\n\nmetrics_no_cov <- get_metrics(example_quantile, exclude = c(\"interval_coverage_50\", \"interval_coverage_90\"))\nmetrics_no_cov_no_ae <- get_metrics(example_quantile, exclude = c(\"interval_coverage_50\", \"interval_coverage_90\", \"ae_median\"))\n\nexample_quantile_df <- as.data.frame(na.omit(example_quantile))\n\n# Pre-computed scores for reuse across tests\nscores_quantile <- score(example_quantile)\nscores_sample_continuous <- score(example_sample_continuous)\nscores_sample_discrete <- score(example_sample_discrete)\nscores_point <- score(example_point)\nscores_binary <- score(example_binary)\nscores_nominal <- score(example_nominal)\n```\n\n**No `helper-*.R` files exist** in the testthat directory. Setup.R provides pre-computed scores fixtures.\n\n### 3. Core Functions in `R/score.R`\n\n#### `score()` (Lines 118-120)\n```r\nscore <- function(forecast, metrics, ...) {\n  UseMethod(\"score\")\n}\n```\nGeneric function that dispatches based on forecast class.\n\n#### `apply_metrics()` (Lines 152-163)\n```r\napply_metrics <- function(forecast, metrics, ...) {\n  lapply(names(metrics), function(metric_name) {\n    result <- do.call(\n      run_safely,\n      list(..., fun = metrics[[metric_name]], metric_name = metric_name)\n    )\n    if (!is.null(result)) {\n      forecast[, (metric_name) := result]\n    }\n  })\n  return(forecast)\n}\n```\n- Applies each metric function to forecast data\n- Calls `run_safely()` for each metric\n- If metric succeeds (returns non-NULL), adds column to forecast\n- If metric fails (returns NULL), no column is added\n\n#### `run_safely()` (Lines 193-224)\n```r\nrun_safely <- function(..., fun, metric_name) {\n  assert_function(fun)\n  args <- list(...)\n  possible_args <- names(formals(fun))\n  \n  # Filter valid arguments based on function signature\n  if (\"...\" %in% possible_args) {\n    valid_args <- args\n  } else if (is.null(names(args))) {\n    valid_args <- args\n  } else {\n    valid_args <- args[!nzchar(names(args)) | names(args) %in% possible_args]\n  }\n  \n  result <- try(do.call(fun, valid_args), silent = TRUE)\n  \n  if (inherits(result, \"try-error\")) {\n    msg <- conditionMessage(attr(result, \"condition\"))\n    cli_warn(\n      c(\n        \"!\" = \"Computation for {.var {metric_name}} failed.\n        Error: {msg}.\"\n      )\n    )\n    return(NULL)\n  }\n  return(result)\n}\n```\n- Wraps metric function calls\n- Filters arguments to only pass valid ones\n- Catches errors with `try()`\n- **Emits warning immediately** when metric fails (line 214)\n- Returns NULL on failure, result on success\n\n#### `validate_metrics()` (Lines 245-267)\n```r\nvalidate_metrics <- function(metrics) {\n  assert_list(metrics, min.len = 1, names = \"named\")\n  \n  for (i in seq_along(metrics)) {\n    check_fun <- check_function(metrics[[i]])\n    if (!isTRUE(check_fun)) {\n      cli_warn(\n        c(\"!\" = \"`Metrics` element number {i} is not a valid function.\")\n      )\n      names(metrics)[i] <- \"scoringutils_delete\"\n    }\n  }\n  metrics[names(metrics) == \"scoringutils_delete\"] <- NULL\n  \n  assert_list(metrics, min.len = 1, .var.name = \"valid metrics\")\n  \n  return(metrics)\n}\n```\n- Validates that each metric is a function\n- Removes invalid metrics by marking them for deletion\n- Warns for each invalid metric\n\n### 4. Score Method Implementations\n\n#### `score.forecast_quantile()` (Lines 127-167 in class-forecast-quantile.R)\n```r\nscore.forecast_quantile <- function(forecast, metrics = get_metrics(forecast), ...) {\n  forecast <- clean_forecast(forecast, copy = TRUE, na.omit = TRUE)\n  forecast_unit <- get_forecast_unit(forecast)\n  metrics <- validate_metrics(metrics)\n  forecast <- as.data.table(forecast)\n  \n  # Transpose forecasts - group by forecast_unit\n  f_transposed <- forecast[, .(\n    predicted = list(predicted[order(quantile_level)]),\n    observed = unique(observed),\n    quantile_level = list(sort(quantile_level, na.last = TRUE)),\n    scoringutils_quantile_level = toString(sort(quantile_level, na.last = TRUE))\n  ), by = forecast_unit]\n  \n  # Split by quantile_level patterns\n  f_split <- split(f_transposed, f_transposed$scoringutils_quantile_level)\n  \n  split_result <- lapply(f_split, function(df) {\n    observed <- df$observed\n    predicted <- do.call(rbind, df$predicted)\n    quantile_level <- unlist(unique(df$quantile_level))\n    df[, c(\"observed\", \"predicted\", \"quantile_level\", \"scoringutils_quantile_level\") := NULL]\n    \n    result <- apply_metrics(df, metrics, observed, predicted, quantile_level)\n    return(result)\n  })\n  scores <- rbindlist(split_result, fill = TRUE)\n  \n  scores <- as_scores(scores, metrics = names(metrics))\n  return(scores[])\n}\n```\n\n**Key Pattern**: Forecast is transposed by forecast_unit, then `apply_metrics()` is called with `observed`, `predicted`, `quantile_level` as unnamed arguments.\n\n#### `score.forecast_binary()` (Lines 106-119 in class-forecast-binary.R)\n```r\nscore.forecast_binary <- function(forecast, metrics = get_metrics(forecast), ...) {\n  forecast <- clean_forecast(forecast, copy = TRUE, na.omit = TRUE)\n  metrics <- validate_metrics(metrics)\n  forecast <- as.data.table(forecast)\n  \n  scores <- apply_metrics(\n    forecast, metrics,\n    forecast$observed, forecast$predicted\n  )\n  scores[, `:=`(predicted = NULL, observed = NULL)]\n  \n  scores <- as_scores(scores, metrics = names(metrics))\n  return(scores[])\n}\n```\n\n**Key Pattern**: Direct call to `apply_metrics()` with `observed` and `predicted`. Then removes predicted/observed columns.\n\n#### `score.forecast_sample()` (Lines 123-154 in class-forecast-sample.R)\nSimilar to quantile - transposes forecasts, splits by number of samples, calls `apply_metrics()` with `observed` and `predicted` matrix.\n\n#### `score.forecast_point()` (Lines 83-96 in class-forecast-point.R)\nSame pattern as binary - direct `apply_metrics()` call.\n\n### 5. Example Datasets\n\n#### `example_quantile` (20,545 rows, 10 columns)\n```\nColumns: location, target_end_date, target_type, observed, location_name, \n         forecast_date, quantile_level, predicted, model, horizon\n\nForecast unit: c(\"location\", \"target_end_date\", \"target_type\", \"location_name\", \n                 \"forecast_date\", \"model\", \"horizon\")\n\nExample row:\n  location = \"DE\", target_end_date = 2021-05-08, target_type = \"Cases\",\n  observed = 106987, quantile_level = 0.010, predicted = 82466,\n  model = \"EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble\", horizon = 1\n```\n\n#### `example_binary` (1,031 rows, 9 columns)\n```\nColumns: location, location_name, target_end_date, target_type, forecast_date,\n         model, horizon, predicted, observed (factor with 2 levels)\n\nForecast unit: c(\"location\", \"location_name\", \"target_end_date\", \"target_type\",\n                 \"forecast_date\", \"model\", \"horizon\")\n\nobserved: Factor with levels \"0\", \"1\"\npredicted: Numeric probability of observed being \"1\"\n```\n\n#### `example_sample_continuous` (35,624 rows, 10 columns)\n```\nColumns: location, location_name, target_end_date, target_type, forecast_date,\n         model, horizon, predicted, sample_id, observed\n\nForecast unit: Same as binary\n\nMultiple samples per forecast (sample_id = 1, 2, 3, ..., ~40 samples per forecast)\n```\n\n#### `example_point` (1,031 rows, 9 columns)\n```\nColumns: location, target_end_date, target_type, observed, location_name,\n         forecast_date, predicted, model, horizon\n\nForecast unit: Same as binary (minus predicted which is protected)\n```\n\n#### `example_nominal` (similar structure to binary but with `predicted_label` column)\nMultiple rows per forecast, one for each possible outcome.\n\n### 6. `get_metrics()` Function\n\nGeneric function that returns different default metrics based on forecast type:\n\n**`get_metrics.forecast_quantile()`** (Lines 200-214 in class-forecast-quantile.R):\n```r\nReturns list(\n  wis = wis,\n  overprediction = overprediction_quantile,\n  underprediction = underprediction_quantile,\n  dispersion = dispersion_quantile,\n  bias = bias_quantile,\n  interval_coverage_50 = interval_coverage,\n  interval_coverage_90 = purrr::partial(interval_coverage, interval_range = 90),\n  ae_median = ae_median_quantile\n)\n```\n\n**`get_metrics.forecast_binary()`** (Lines 144-150 in class-forecast-binary.R):\n```r\nReturns list(\n  brier_score = brier_score,\n  log_score = logs_binary\n)\n```\n\n**`get_metrics.forecast_sample()`** (Lines 178-192 in class-forecast-sample.R):\n```r\nReturns list(\n  bias = bias_sample,\n  dss = dss_sample,\n  crps = crps_sample,\n  overprediction = overprediction_sample,\n  underprediction = underprediction_sample,\n  dispersion = dispersion_sample,\n  log_score = logs_sample,\n  mad = mad_sample,\n  ae_median = ae_median_sample,\n  se_mean = se_mean_sample\n)\n```\n\n**`get_metrics.forecast_point()`** (Lines 146-153 in class-forecast-point.R):\n```r\nReturns list(\n  ae_point = Metrics::ae,\n  se_point = Metrics::se,\n  ape = Metrics::ape\n)\n```\n\n**`get_metrics.forecast_nominal()`** (Lines 166-171 in class-forecast-nominal.R):\n```r\nReturns list(\n  log_score = logs_categorical\n)\n```\n\n**`get_metrics.scores()`** (Lines 113-142 in class-scores.R):\nReturns the `metrics` attribute (character vector of metric names used for scoring).\n\n### 7. Protected Columns & Forecast Unit\n\n**`get_protected_columns()`** (R/get-protected-columns.R):\n```r\nReturns: c(\n  \".mv_group_id\",\n  \"predicted\", \"observed\", \"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\", \"upper\", \"lower\",\n  \"pit_value\", \"interval_range\", \"boundary\", \"predicted_label\",\n  \"interval_coverage\", \"interval_coverage_deviation\",\n  \"quantile_coverage\", \"quantile_coverage_deviation\",\n  # Plus any columns matching patterns like \"_relative_skill$\" or \"coverage_\"\n)\n```\n\n**`get_forecast_unit(data)`**:\nReturns all column names EXCEPT:\n1. Protected columns (from `get_protected_columns()`)\n2. Metric names (from `attr(data, \"metrics\")` if it's a scores object)\n\nThis is critical: **If a metric name matches a column name in the forecast, that column will be excluded from the forecast_unit after scoring**, potentially causing issues.\n\n### 8. Scores Object Structure\n\n**Class**: `c(\"scores\", \"data.table\", \"data.frame\")`\n\n**Attributes**:\n- `metrics`: Character vector of metric names used for scoring\n\n**Example scored binary forecast**:\n```\n887 rows × 9 columns\nColumns: location, location_name, target_end_date, target_type, forecast_date,\n         model, horizon, brier_score, log_score\n\nattr(*, \"metrics\") = c(\"brier_score\", \"log_score\")\n\nForecast unit (after scoring): c(\"location\", \"location_name\", \"target_end_date\",\n                                  \"target_type\", \"forecast_date\", \"model\", \"horizon\")\n```\n\nNote: `observed` and `predicted` are removed after scoring in binary/point forecasts.\n\n### 9. Existing Test Patterns\n\n**Common patterns in test-score.R**:\n```r\n# Testing with pre-computed scores from setup.R\nexpect_no_condition(assert_scores(scores_point))\n\n# Testing specific output\nexpect_s3_class(scores, c(\"scores\", \"data.table\", \"data.frame\"), exact = TRUE)\n\n# Testing row counts\nexpect_identical(nrow(eval), 887L)\n\n# Testing warnings\nexpect_warning(\n  score(onesample),\n  \"Computation for `log_score` failed.

Test File Structure: `tests/testthat/test-score.R`\n\n**Lines 40-70 Analysis:**\nLines 40-70 of `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/test-score.R` contain:\n- **Lines 40-41**: Section header comment for `score()` tests\n- **Lines 44-49**: Test that `score()` throws error for non-forecast objects\n- **Lines 51-58**: Test for manipulating scores objects with `[` operator (data.table subsetting)\n- **Lines 62-84**: Test for continuous forecast format scoring\n\n**Important Note**: There is **NO commented-out test skeleton** for metric/column name clash detection in lines 40-70. The user's description appears to be mistaken or refers to a different issue. However, Ralph's issue #811 (batch failed metric warnings) does exist and has detailed test specifications.\n\n### 2. Test Helper Files & Setup\n\n**`tests/testthat/setup.R`** (6 lines total):\n```r\ndata.table::setDTthreads(2)\n\nmetrics_no_cov <- get_metrics(example_quantile, exclude = c(\"interval_coverage_50\", \"interval_coverage_90\"))\nmetrics_no_cov_no_ae <- get_metrics(example_quantile, exclude = c(\"interval_coverage_50\", \"interval_coverage_90\", \"ae_median\"))\n\nexample_quantile_df <- as.data.frame(na.omit(example_quantile))\n\n# Pre-computed scores for reuse across tests\nscores_quantile <- score(example_quantile)\nscores_sample_continuous <- score(example_sample_continuous)\nscores_sample_discrete <- score(example_sample_discrete)\nscores_point <- score(example_point)\nscores_binary <- score(example_binary)\nscores_nominal <- score(example_nominal)\n```\n\n**No `helper-*.R` files exist** in the testthat directory. Setup.R provides pre-computed scores fixtures.\n\n### 3. Core Functions in `R/score.R`\n\n#### `score()` (Lines 118-120)\n```r\nscore <- function(forecast, metrics, ...) {\n  UseMethod(\"score\")\n}\n```\nGeneric function that dispatches based on forecast class.\n\n#### `apply_metrics()` (Lines 152-163)\n```r\napply_metrics <- function(forecast, metrics, ...) {\n  lapply(names(metrics), function(metric_name) {\n    result <- do.call(\n      run_safely,\n      list(..., fun = metrics[[metric_name]], metric_name = metric_name)\n    )\n    if (!is.null(result)) {\n      forecast[, (metric_name) := result]\n    }\n  })\n  return(forecast)\n}\n```\n- Applies each metric function to forecast data\n- Calls `run_safely()` for each metric\n- If metric succeeds (returns non-NULL), adds column to forecast\n- If metric fails (returns NULL), no column is added\n\n#### `run_safely()` (Lines 193-224)\n```r\nrun_safely <- function(..., fun, metric_name) {\n  assert_function(fun)\n  args <- list(...)\n  possible_args <- names(formals(fun))\n  \n  # Filter valid arguments based on function signature\n  if (\"...\" %in% possible_args) {\n    valid_args <- args\n  } else if (is.null(names(args))) {\n    valid_args <- args\n  } else {\n    valid_args <- args[!nzchar(names(args)) | names(args) %in% possible_args]\n  }\n  \n  result <- try(do.call(fun, valid_args), silent = TRUE)\n  \n  if (inherits(result, \"try-error\")) {\n    msg <- conditionMessage(attr(result, \"condition\"))\n    cli_warn(\n      c(\n        \"!\" = \"Computation for {.var {metric_name}} failed.\n        Error: {msg}.\"\n      )\n    )\n    return(NULL)\n  }\n  return(result)\n}\n```\n- Wraps metric function calls\n- Filters arguments to only pass valid ones\n- Catches errors with `try()`\n- **Emits warning immediately** when metric fails (line 214)\n- Returns NULL on failure, result on success\n\n#### `validate_metrics()` (Lines 245-267)\n```r\nvalidate_metrics <- function(metrics) {\n  assert_list(metrics, min.len = 1, names = \"named\")\n  \n  for (i in seq_along(metrics)) {\n    check_fun <- check_function(metrics[[i]])\n    if (!isTRUE(check_fun)) {\n      cli_warn(\n        c(\"!\" = \"`Metrics` element number {i} is not a valid function.\")\n      )\n      names(metrics)[i] <- \"scoringutils_delete\"\n    }\n  }\n  metrics[names(metrics) == \"scoringutils_delete\"] <- NULL\n  \n  assert_list(metrics, min.len = 1, .var.name = \"valid metrics\")\n  \n  return(metrics)\n}\n```\n- Validates that each metric is a function\n- Removes invalid metrics by marking them for deletion\n- Warns for each invalid metric\n\n### 4. Score Method Implementations\n\n#### `score.forecast_quantile()` (Lines 127-167 in class-forecast-quantile.R)\n```r\nscore.forecast_quantile <- function(forecast, metrics = get_metrics(forecast), ...) {\n  forecast <- clean_forecast(forecast, copy = TRUE, na.omit = TRUE)\n  forecast_unit <- get_forecast_unit(forecast)\n  metrics <- validate_metrics(metrics)\n  forecast <- as.data.table(forecast)\n  \n  # Transpose forecasts - group by forecast_unit\n  f_transposed <- forecast[, .(\n    predicted = list(predicted[order(quantile_level)]),\n    observed = unique(observed),\n    quantile_level = list(sort(quantile_level, na.last = TRUE)),\n    scoringutils_quantile_level = toString(sort(quantile_level, na.last = TRUE))\n  ), by = forecast_unit]\n  \n  # Split by quantile_level patterns\n  f_split <- split(f_transposed, f_transposed$scoringutils_quantile_level)\n  \n  split_result <- lapply(f_split, function(df) {\n    observed <- df$observed\n    predicted <- do.call(rbind, df$predicted)\n    quantile_level <- unlist(unique(df$quantile_level))\n    df[, c(\"observed\", \"predicted\", \"quantile_level\", \"scoringutils_quantile_level\") := NULL]\n    \n    result <- apply_metrics(df, metrics, observed, predicted, quantile_level)\n    return(result)\n  })\n  scores <- rbindlist(split_result, fill = TRUE)\n  \n  scores <- as_scores(scores, metrics = names(metrics))\n  return(scores[])\n}\n```\n\n**Key Pattern**: Forecast is transposed by forecast_unit, then `apply_metrics()` is called with `observed`, `predicted`, `quantile_level` as unnamed arguments.\n\n#### `score.forecast_binary()` (Lines 106-119 in class-forecast-binary.R)\n```r\nscore.forecast_binary <- function(forecast, metrics = get_metrics(forecast), ...) {\n  forecast <- clean_forecast(forecast, copy = TRUE, na.omit = TRUE)\n  metrics <- validate_metrics(metrics)\n  forecast <- as.data.table(forecast)\n  \n  scores <- apply_metrics(\n    forecast, metrics,\n    forecast$observed, forecast$predicted\n  )\n  scores[, `:=`(predicted = NULL, observed = NULL)]\n  \n  scores <- as_scores(scores, metrics = names(metrics))\n  return(scores[])\n}\n```\n\n**Key Pattern**: Direct call to `apply_metrics()` with `observed` and `predicted`. Then removes predicted/observed columns.\n\n#### `score.forecast_sample()` (Lines 123-154 in class-forecast-sample.R)\nSimilar to quantile - transposes forecasts, splits by number of samples, calls `apply_metrics()` with `observed` and `predicted` matrix.\n\n#### `score.forecast_point()` (Lines 83-96 in class-forecast-point.R)\nSame pattern as binary - direct `apply_metrics()` call.\n\n### 5. Example Datasets\n\n#### `example_quantile` (20,545 rows, 10 columns)\n```\nColumns: location, target_end_date, target_type, observed, location_name, \n         forecast_date, quantile_level, predicted, model, horizon\n\nForecast unit: c(\"location\", \"target_end_date\", \"target_type\", \"location_name\", \n                 \"forecast_date\", \"model\", \"horizon\")\n\nExample row:\n  location = \"DE\", target_end_date = 2021-05-08, target_type = \"Cases\",\n  observed = 106987, quantile_level = 0.010, predicted = 82466,\n  model = \"EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble\", horizon = 1\n```\n\n#### `example_binary` (1,031 rows, 9 columns)\n```\nColumns: location, location_name, target_end_date, target_type, forecast_date,\n         model, horizon, predicted, observed (factor with 2 levels)\n\nForecast unit: c(\"location\", \"location_name\", \"target_end_date\", \"target_type\",\n                 \"forecast_date\", \"model\", \"horizon\")\n\nobserved: Factor with levels \"0\", \"1\"\npredicted: Numeric probability of observed being \"1\"\n```\n\n#### `example_sample_continuous` (35,624 rows, 10 columns)\n```\nColumns: location, location_name, target_end_date, target_type, forecast_date,\n         model, horizon, predicted, sample_id, observed\n\nForecast unit: Same as binary\n\nMultiple samples per forecast (sample_id = 1, 2, 3, ..., ~40 samples per forecast)\n```\n\n#### `example_point` (1,031 rows, 9 columns)\n```\nColumns: location, target_end_date, target_type, observed, location_name,\n         forecast_date, predicted, model, horizon\n\nForecast unit: Same as binary (minus predicted which is protected)\n```\n\n#### `example_nominal` (similar structure to binary but with `predicted_label` column)\nMultiple rows per forecast, one for each possible outcome.\n\n### 6. `get_metrics()` Function\n\nGeneric function that returns different default metrics based on forecast type:\n\n**`get_metrics.forecast_quantile()`** (Lines 200-214 in class-forecast-quantile.R):\n```r\nReturns list(\n  wis = wis,\n  overprediction = overprediction_quantile,\n  underprediction = underprediction_quantile,\n  dispersion = dispersion_quantile,\n  bias = bias_quantile,\n  interval_coverage_50 = interval_coverage,\n  interval_coverage_90 = purrr::partial(interval_coverage, interval_range = 90),\n  ae_median = ae_median_quantile\n)\n```\n\n**`get_metrics.forecast_binary()`** (Lines 144-150 in class-forecast-binary.R):\n```r\nReturns list(\n  brier_score = brier_score,\n  log_score = logs_binary\n)\n```\n\n**`get_metrics.forecast_sample()`** (Lines 178-192 in class-forecast-sample.R):\n```r\nReturns list(\n  bias = bias_sample,\n  dss = dss_sample,\n  crps = crps_sample,\n  overprediction = overprediction_sample,\n  underprediction = underprediction_sample,\n  dispersion = dispersion_sample,\n  log_score = logs_sample,\n  mad = mad_sample,\n  ae_median = ae_median_sample,\n  se_mean = se_mean_sample\n)\n```\n\n**`get_metrics.forecast_point()`** (Lines 146-153 in class-forecast-point.R):\n```r\nReturns list(\n  ae_point = Metrics::ae,\n  se_point = Metrics::se,\n  ape = Metrics::ape\n)\n```\n\n**`get_metrics.forecast_nominal()`** (Lines 166-171 in class-forecast-nominal.R):\n```r\nReturns list(\n  log_score = logs_categorical\n)\n```\n\n**`get_metrics.scores()`** (Lines 113-142 in class-scores.R):\nReturns the `metrics` attribute (character vector of metric names used for scoring).\n\n### 7. Protected Columns & Forecast Unit\n\n**`get_protected_columns()`** (R/get-protected-columns.R):\n```r\nReturns: c(\n  \".mv_group_id\",\n  \"predicted\", \"observed\", \"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\", \"upper\", \"lower\",\n  \"pit_value\", \"interval_range\", \"boundary\", \"predicted_label\",\n  \"interval_coverage\", \"interval_coverage_deviation\",\n  \"quantile_coverage\", \"quantile_coverage_deviation\",\n  # Plus any columns matching patterns like \"_relative_skill$\" or \"coverage_\"\n)\n```\n\n**`get_forecast_unit(data)`**:\nReturns all column names EXCEPT:\n1. Protected columns (from `get_protected_columns()`)\n2. Metric names (from `attr(data, \"metrics\")` if it's a scores object)\n\nThis is critical: **If a metric name matches a column name in the forecast, that column will be excluded from the forecast_unit after scoring**, potentially causing issues.\n\n### 8. Scores Object Structure\n\n**Class**: `c(\"scores\", \"data.table\", \"data.frame\")`\n\n**Attributes**:\n- `metrics`: Character vector of metric names used for scoring\n\n**Example scored binary forecast**:\n```\n887 rows × 9 columns\nColumns: location, location_name, target_end_date, target_type, forecast_date,\n         model, horizon, brier_score, log_score\n\nattr(*, \"metrics\") = c(\"brier_score\", \"log_score\")\n\nForecast unit (after scoring): c(\"location\", \"location_name\", \"target_end_date\",\n                                  \"target_type\", \"forecast_date\", \"model\", \"horizon\")\n```\n\nNote: `observed` and `predicted` are removed after scoring in binary/point forecasts.\n\n### 9. Existing Test Patterns\n\n**Common patterns in test-score.R**:\n```r\n# Testing with pre-computed scores from setup.R\nexpect_no_condition(assert_scores(scores_point))\n\n# Testing specific output\nexpect_s3_class(scores, c(\"scores\", \"data.table\", \"data.frame\"), exact = TRUE)\n\n# Testing row counts\nexpect_identical(nrow(eval), 887L)\n\n# Testing warnings\nexpect_warning(\n  score(onesample),\n  \"Computation for `log_score` failed. Error: need at least 2 data points.\"\n)\n\n# Testing with custom metrics\nscore(example, metrics = list(custom = custom_function))\n\n# Using suppressWarnings for known warnings\nscoreonesample <- suppressWarnings(score(onesample))\n\n# Testing internal functions with :::\nscoringutils:::apply_metrics(...)\n```\n\n**Testing validation**:\n```r\nexpect_error(validate_metrics(...), \"not a valid function\")\nexpect_warning(validate_metrics(...), \"element number 3 is not a valid function\")\n```\n\n### 10. Function Signatures (Critical for Testing)\n\n**Metric function signatures vary by forecast type**:\n\n**Quantile metrics**: `function(observed, predicted, quantile_level, ...)`\n**Sample metrics**: `function(observed, predicted, ...)`\n**Binary metrics**: `function(observed, predicted, ...)`\n**Point metrics**: `function(observed, predicted, ...)`\n\n**Example**:\n```r\n# From tests/testthat/test-score.R lines 163-168\ntest_fun <- function(x, y, ...) {\n  if (hasArg(\"test\")) {\n    message(\"test argument found\")\n  }\n  return(y)\n}\n```\n\n### 11.

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature). If yes, run `usethis::use_release_issue()` and proceed with CRAN submission. If not, close the issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1064 | Pre-ranking for multivariate calibration assessment | | 2026-01-30 | feature | medium | large | no | No pre-ranking or multivariate calibration diagnostics exist in the codebase. The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al. (2008) as calibration diagnostics for multivariate forecasts, after resolving the API design choice with maintainers. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1057 | Revise README to remove news about the package rewrite | documentation | 2026-01-29 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Open, no assignee. The rewrite messaging and Google Drive paper links appear in 4 locations in README.Rmd. Mechanical edits are straightforward but replacement text requires editorial decisions about where to point users for documentation. | Loosely related to #810 (pkgdown for dev docs) and #759 (future of scoringutils.Rmd vignette). | Edit `README.Rmd` to remove/soften the \"major re-write\" paragraph and replace Google Drive paper links with pointers to package vignettes/docs, then re-render README.md. Confirm preferred documentation hierarchy with maintainers first. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1055 | Model confidence sets | feature request | 2026-01-19 | feature | medium | large | no | Design phase — methodology not yet agreed upon. 6 comments with active debate. Naive pairwise p-value approach acknowledged as incomplete. Three alternatives discussed: Hansen et al. MCS, novel extension for incomplete sets, Bayesian approach. No consensus reached. | Relates to #750 (p-value computation refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #37 (Diebold-Mariano test), #1022 (two-model pairwise). | Resolve design consensus on which MCS methodology to implement (Hansen et al. on complete sets, novel incomplete-set extension, or Bayesian), then implement `get_model_confidence_set()` building on existing pairwise comparison infrastructure. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1046 | multivariate scoring in scoring rules vignette | documentation | 2025-11-04 | documentation | low | small | partially | Open, agreed upon by maintainers. The scoring-rules vignette has zero mentions of multivariate scoring. A dedicated multivariate vignette already exists. Only a cross-reference and brief section are missing. | None. All underlying code and the dedicated multivariate vignette already exist. | Add a short section to `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd` describing the energy score for multivariate forecasts and cross-linking to the existing `scoring-multivariate-forecasts` vignette. No code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1044 | Remove the commented out vignette code. | | 2025-09-23 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Two HTML comment blocks remain: a WIP \"Details on the grouping\" section in `scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` (lines 88-102) and a ~50-line PIT/Calibration section in `scoring-rules.Rmd` (lines 444-493). Originated from PR #998 review comment. | None. | Delete the two HTML-commented-out code blocks from `vignettes/scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` and `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd`. Optionally confirm with maintainers whether the PIT/Calibration text should be preserved elsewhere. | N/A | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1043 | Update print method for multivariate forecasts to show `joint_across` | | 2025-09-21 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output. Update test snapshots. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1026 | as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile | enhancement | 2025-07-13 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples. Requires design decision on approximation method and potential new package dependency. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1022 | Let `get_pairwise_comparison()` run with two models? | | 2025-07-03 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Unlike siblings (#930, #933, #934), the calibration/sharpness PNG does **not** exist in the repo — it was never generated. Code to create it is in the issue body. The `scoring-rules.Rmd` has a commented-out calibration section (lines ~449-492) where this illustration would naturally fit. | Sibling issues #930, #933, #934. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #759 (vignette future), #785 (vignette updates). | Generate `calibration-sharpness-illustration.png` from the code in the issue body, place in `vignettes/`, and integrate into `scoring-rules.Rmd` (or a new \"Choosing a score\" vignette). Coordinate with #930/#933/#934 batch. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 927 | Make all internal columns, in particular `forecast_id`, more robust by prefixing it with \"scoringutils_\" | good first issue, high-priority | 2024-09-26 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. Unprefixed internal columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) risk collision with user data columns. Codebase already mixes two conventions: `.scoringutils_*` (e.g., `.scoringutils_N`) and `scoringutils_Internal*`. ~3 source files, 1 globalVariables file, 1 snapshot to update for `forecast_id` alone. Not a breaking change — all affected columns are internal. | None blocking. Self-contained refactor. | Rename unprefixed internal temp columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) to `.scoringutils_` prefix, matching existing convention. Update `R/helper-quantile-interval-range.R`, `R/metrics-quantile.R`, `R/z-globalVariables.R`, and test snapshots. Also unify the two naming conventions (`.scoringutils_*` vs `scoringutils_Internal*`). | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 922 | remove `check_columns_present` | | 2024-09-25 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `check_columns_present` (and `test_columns_present`) are internal functions with 10 call sites across 9 files. All can be replaced by `checkmate::assert_subset`/`check_subset`/`test_subset` (already a dependency). One call site in `pairwise-comparisons.R:143` uses a custom error message and needs slightly different handling. No user-facing API impact. | Related to #839 (remove `test_columns_not_present`) — both modify `R/check-input-helpers.R`, should be batched. | Replace all 10 call sites of `check_columns_present` (and 1 of `test_columns_present`) with equivalent `checkmate` functions, then delete both functions and their tests. Consider batching with #839. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 909 | Compact version of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` | enhancement, good first issue, help wanted | 2024-09-13 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Already implemented. The `counts` parameter on `get_duplicate_forecasts()` provides exactly the compact output requested. Tests exist. Issue can be closed. | None | Close this issue — the `counts` argument already provides compact/aggregated duplicate output. No further code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 907 | coverage of function factory | enhancement | 2024-09-12 | enhancement | low | small | partially | Still relevant. No factory helper exists. Users must manually use `purrr::partial()` (documented in `score()` docs). Only `interval_coverage` benefits currently. Hard-coded 50% and 90% variants in `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()`. Discussion stalled after 5 comments with no consensus on approach. | Related to #451 (quantile/interval metric organization), #668 (coverage flexibility). | Add either a generic `expand_metric()` utility or a `coverage_ranges` argument to `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()` to programmatically generate multiple parameterized coverage metric variants. Needs design decision on approach given only one metric currently benefits. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 898 | Support for \"Mixture of Parameters\" scoring | feature request | 2024-09-06 | feature | low | large | partially | Still relevant but low urgency. No `forecast_distribution` class exists. Prerequisites #832 (metrics S3 rework) and #846 (ordinal class) are done. Original requester has deprioritized. Would require new class, input format design, dispatch to `scoringRules` parametric functions, and mixture handling. | #888 (S3 rework of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` — minor blocker for clean extensibility).
