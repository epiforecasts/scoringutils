Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    33→| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    34→| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    42→| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

Now I have all the information I need. Let me create a comprehensive summary of all my findings.\n\n## Comprehensive Exploration Report: scoringutils-pipeline\n\nI've conducted a thorough exploration of the scoringutils-pipeline repository. Here are all my detailed findings:\n\n### 1. **`R/class-scores.R` - The Scores Class Definition**\n**File path:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-scores.R`\n\n**Key Functions:**\n\n- **`new_scores()` (lines 20-25)**\n  - Constructor function that creates a `scores` object\n  - Parameters: `scores` (data.table or similar), `metrics` (character vector of scoring rule names), `...` (additional arguments to `as.data.table()`)\n  - Sets class to `c(\"scores\", class(scores))` \n  - Uses `setattr(scores, \"metrics\", metrics)` to store the metrics attribute\n  - Returns `scores[]` (forces evaluation)\n\n- **`as_scores()` (lines 34-40)**\n  - Convenience wrapper around `new_scores()` that validates the scores object\n  - Filters metrics to only those present in the data: `present_metrics <- metrics[metrics %in% colnames(scores)]`\n  - Calls `assert_scores()` for validation\n  - Returns `scores[]`\n\n- **`assert_scores()` (lines 51-58)**\n  - Validates that input is a data.frame and has class `scores`\n  - Ensures `metrics` attribute exists by calling `get_metrics.scores(scores, error = TRUE)`\n  - Returns `NULL` invisibly\n\n- **`[.scores` method (lines 63-71)**\n  - @method `[` scores (line 60)\n  - @export (line 62)\n  - Custom subsetting method that preserves the `metrics` attribute\n  - Works with both data.table results: `setattr(ret, \"metrics\", attr(x, \"metrics\"))`\n  - And data.frame results: `attr(ret, \"metrics\") <- attr(x, \"metrics\")`\n\n- **`get_metrics.scores()` (lines 113-142)**\n  - @export (line 112)\n  - @family get_metrics functions (line 111)\n  - @keywords handle-metrics (line 110)\n  - Retrieves and returns the `metrics` attribute\n  - Parameters: `x` (scores object), `error` (boolean - throw error if metrics missing), `...` (unused)\n  - If `error = TRUE` and no metrics: throws error via `cli_abort()`\n  - Validates consistency: checks that all metrics are in column names\n  - If metrics mismatch: warns via `cli_warn()`\n  - Returns: Character vector with names of scoring rules used\n\n**Key Pattern:** The `metrics` attribute stores a character vector of column names that contain metric values, distinguishing them from forecast unit columns.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Existing `print.forecast()` Method (Pattern Reference)**\n**File path:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast.R` (lines 400-465)\n\n**Key characteristics of the `print.forecast()` method:**\n\n```r\nprint.forecast <- function(x, ...) {\n  # Lines 415-465\n  # Uses cli_inform() and cli_text() for formatted output\n  # Gets forecast_type via get_forecast_type()\n  # Gets forecast_unit via get_forecast_unit()\n  # Uses try() to catch errors gracefully\n  # Uses col_blue() for colored text\n  # Calls NextMethod() to delegate to parent print method\n  # Returns x invisibly\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern details (lines 400-410):**\n- @title comment\n- @description comment\n- @param x A forecast object\n- @param ... Additional arguments for print()\n- @returns Returns `x` invisibly\n- @importFrom cli cli_inform cli_warn col_blue cli_text\n- @export\n- @keywords gain-insights\n\n**Key output pattern (lines 415-462):**\n- Try to get forecast_type\n- Try to get forecast_unit\n- Use `cli_text()` with `col_blue()` for headings\n- Use `cli_inform()` for informational messages\n- Call `NextMethod()` to print the underlying data.table\n- Return `invisible(x)`\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`summarise_scores()` Function**\n**File path:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/summarise_scores.R`\n\n**Function signature (lines 51-54):**\n```r\nsummarise_scores <- function(scores,\n                             by = \"model\",\n                             fun = mean,\n                             ...)\n```\n\n**Key operations:**\n- Line 56: `assert_data_frame(scores)`\n- Line 57: `scores <- ensure_data.table(scores)`\n- Line 58: `assert_subset(by, names(scores), empty.ok = FALSE)`\n- Line 59: `assert_function(fun)`\n- Line 61: `metrics <- get_metrics.scores(scores, error = TRUE)` - Gets metrics from attribute\n- Lines 64-67: Uses data.table's `.SDcols` to select only metric columns: `colnames(scores) %like% paste(metrics, collapse = \"|\")`\n- Line 69: **Critical - preserves metrics attribute:** `attr(scores, \"metrics\") <- metrics`\n- Line 70: Returns `scores[]`\n- Lines 73-76: Also exports `summarize_scores` as alias\n\n**Important:** The function filters the data.table to only metric columns and preserves the metrics attribute on the result.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Search Results for `print.scores` References**\n**Status:** No `print.scores` method exists in the codebase\n- Grep search across all R files returned: \"No matches found\"\n- This means if we add a `print.scores()` method, it would be NEW functionality\n\n---\n\n### 5. **How the `metrics` Attribute is Used Throughout**\n\n**Files using `metrics` attribute:**\n\na) **Score creation (all forecast types):**\n   - `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast-binary.R:117`: `scores <- as_scores(scores, metrics = names(metrics))`\n   - `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast-quantile.R:164`: Same pattern\n   - `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast-sample.R:152`: Same pattern\n   - Similar patterns in: ordinal, nominal, point, multivariate-sample forecast classes\n\nb) **Attribute preservation:**\n   - `class-scores.R:23`: `setattr(scores, \"metrics\", metrics)` - Initial set\n   - `class-scores.R:66-68`: Preserves in subsetting via `[.scores` method\n   - `summarise_scores.R:69`: Preserves after summarisation\n\nc) **Attribute retrieval:**\n   - `get_metrics.scores()` retrieves it for validation\n   - Used in `get_correlations.R:29` (line 29): `metrics = get_metrics.scores(scores)`\n   - Used in `pairwise-comparisons.R:626`: Updates metrics when adding new columns: `scores <- new_scores(scores, metrics = c(metrics, new_metrics))`\n\nd) **Test patterns** (`test-summarise_scores.R:43-58`)\n   - Verifies metrics attribute is preserved\n   - Tests error handling when metrics is NULL\n   - Tests warnings when metric columns are renamed\n\n---\n\n### 6. **`R/summarise_scores.R` - Complete File**\n**File path:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/summarise_scores.R` (77 lines total)\n\n**Documentation (lines 1-49):**\n- @title: \"Summarise scores as produced by score()\"\n- @description: Explains that it relies on `metrics` attribute to identify score columns\n- Warns about renaming scores and needing to update the `metrics` attribute manually\n- @param scores: An object of class `scores`\n- @param by: Character vector with column names to summarise by (default: \"model\")\n- @param fun: Function for summarising (default: `mean`)\n- @param ...: Additional parameters to pass to fun\n- @return: A data.table with summarised scores\n- Includes comprehensive examples\n- @export\n- @importFrom checkmate: assert_subset, assert_function, test_subset, assert_data_frame\n- @keywords scoring\n\n**Implementation (lines 51-71):**\n- Input validation\n- Extracts metrics via `get_metrics.scores(scores, error = TRUE)`\n- Uses pattern matching: `.SDcols = colnames(scores) %like% paste(metrics, collapse = \"|\")`\n- Applies function by groups specified in `by` parameter\n- **Preserves metrics attribute:** Line 69\n- Returns `scores[]`\n\n**Alias (lines 73-76):**\n- Exports `summarize_scores` as American English alias\n- `summarize_scores <- summarise_scores`\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Scores Object Class Structure**\n\nFrom test results (`test-score.R:6-10`):\n```\nExpected class: c(\"scores\", \"data.table\", \"data.frame\")\n```\n\n**Class hierarchy:**\n- Primary: `scores` (custom class)\n- Secondary: `data.table` (from `as.data.table()`)\n- Tertiary: `data.frame` (inherited from data.table)\n\n**Associated attributes:**\n- `metrics`: Character vector of metric column names\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Key Files:\n\n| File | Purpose | Key Content |\n|------|---------|------------|\n| `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-scores.R` | Core scores class definition | `new_scores()`, `as_scores()`, `assert_scores()`, `[.scores`, `get_metrics.scores()` |\n| `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast.R` | Forecast class with print method | `print.forecast()` (lines 400-465) -

Let me create a comprehensive summary of all my findings.\n\n## Comprehensive Exploration Report: scoringutils-pipeline\n\nI've conducted a thorough exploration of the scoringutils-pipeline repository. Here are all my detailed findings:\n\n### 1. **`R/class-scores.R` - The Scores Class Definition**\n**File path:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-scores.R`\n\n**Key Functions:**\n\n- **`new_scores()` (lines 20-25)**\n  - Constructor function that creates a `scores` object\n  - Parameters: `scores` (data.table or similar), `metrics` (character vector of scoring rule names), `...` (additional arguments to `as.data.table()`)\n  - Sets class to `c(\"scores\", class(scores))` \n  - Uses `setattr(scores, \"metrics\", metrics)` to store the metrics attribute\n  - Returns `scores[]` (forces evaluation)\n\n- **`as_scores()` (lines 34-40)**\n  - Convenience wrapper around `new_scores()` that validates the scores object\n  - Filters metrics to only those present in the data: `present_metrics <- metrics[metrics %in% colnames(scores)]`\n  - Calls `assert_scores()` for validation\n  - Returns `scores[]`\n\n- **`assert_scores()` (lines 51-58)**\n  - Validates that input is a data.frame and has class `scores`\n  - Ensures `metrics` attribute exists by calling `get_metrics.scores(scores, error = TRUE)`\n  - Returns `NULL` invisibly\n\n- **`[.scores` method (lines 63-71)**\n  - @method `[` scores (line 60)\n  - @export (line 62)\n  - Custom subsetting method that preserves the `metrics` attribute\n  - Works with both data.table results: `setattr(ret, \"metrics\", attr(x, \"metrics\"))`\n  - And data.frame results: `attr(ret, \"metrics\") <- attr(x, \"metrics\")`\n\n- **`get_metrics.scores()` (lines 113-142)**\n  - @export (line 112)\n  - @family get_metrics functions (line 111)\n  - @keywords handle-metrics (line 110)\n  - Retrieves and returns the `metrics` attribute\n  - Parameters: `x` (scores object), `error` (boolean - throw error if metrics missing), `...` (unused)\n  - If `error = TRUE` and no metrics: throws error via `cli_abort()`\n  - Validates consistency: checks that all metrics are in column names\n  - If metrics mismatch: warns via `cli_warn()`\n  - Returns: Character vector with names of scoring rules used\n\n**Key Pattern:** The `metrics` attribute stores a character vector of column names that contain metric values, distinguishing them from forecast unit columns.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Existing `print.forecast()` Method (Pattern Reference)**\n**File path:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast.R` (lines 400-465)\n\n**Key characteristics of the `print.forecast()` method:**\n\n```r\nprint.forecast <- function(x, ...) {\n  # Lines 415-465\n  # Uses cli_inform() and cli_text() for formatted output\n  # Gets forecast_type via get_forecast_type()\n  # Gets forecast_unit via get_forecast_unit()\n  # Uses try() to catch errors gracefully\n  # Uses col_blue() for colored text\n  # Calls NextMethod() to delegate to parent print method\n  # Returns x invisibly\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern details (lines 400-410):**\n- @title comment\n- @description comment\n- @param x A forecast object\n- @param ... Additional arguments for print()\n- @returns Returns `x` invisibly\n- @importFrom cli cli_inform cli_warn col_blue cli_text\n- @export\n- @keywords gain-insights\n\n**Key output pattern (lines 415-462):**\n- Try to get forecast_type\n- Try to get forecast_unit\n- Use `cli_text()` with `col_blue()` for headings\n- Use `cli_inform()` for informational messages\n- Call `NextMethod()` to print the underlying data.table\n- Return `invisible(x)`\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`summarise_scores()` Function**\n**File path:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/summarise_scores.R`\n\n**Function signature (lines 51-54):**\n```r\nsummarise_scores <- function(scores,\n                             by = \"model\",\n                             fun = mean,\n                             ...)\n```\n\n**Key operations:**\n- Line 56: `assert_data_frame(scores)`\n- Line 57: `scores <- ensure_data.table(scores)`\n- Line 58: `assert_subset(by, names(scores), empty.ok = FALSE)`\n- Line 59: `assert_function(fun)`\n- Line 61: `metrics <- get_metrics.scores(scores, error = TRUE)` - Gets metrics from attribute\n- Lines 64-67: Uses data.table's `.SDcols` to select only metric columns: `colnames(scores) %like% paste(metrics, collapse = \"|\")`\n- Line 69: **Critical - preserves metrics attribute:** `attr(scores, \"metrics\") <- metrics`\n- Line 70: Returns `scores[]`\n- Lines 73-76: Also exports `summarize_scores` as alias\n\n**Important:** The function filters the data.table to only metric columns and preserves the metrics attribute on the result.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Search Results for `print.scores` References**\n**Status:** No `print.scores` method exists in the codebase\n- Grep search across all R files returned: \"No matches found\"\n- This means if we add a `print.scores()` method, it would be NEW functionality\n\n---\n\n### 5. **How the `metrics` Attribute is Used Throughout**\n\n**Files using `metrics` attribute:**\n\na) **Score creation (all forecast types):**\n   - `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast-binary.R:117`: `scores <- as_scores(scores, metrics = names(metrics))`\n   - `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast-quantile.R:164`: Same pattern\n   - `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast-sample.R:152`: Same pattern\n   - Similar patterns in: ordinal, nominal, point, multivariate-sample forecast classes\n\nb) **Attribute preservation:**\n   - `class-scores.R:23`: `setattr(scores, \"metrics\", metrics)` - Initial set\n   - `class-scores.R:66-68`: Preserves in subsetting via `[.scores` method\n   - `summarise_scores.R:69`: Preserves after summarisation\n\nc) **Attribute retrieval:**\n   - `get_metrics.scores()` retrieves it for validation\n   - Used in `get_correlations.R:29` (line 29): `metrics = get_metrics.scores(scores)`\n   - Used in `pairwise-comparisons.R:626`: Updates metrics when adding new columns: `scores <- new_scores(scores, metrics = c(metrics, new_metrics))`\n\nd) **Test patterns** (`test-summarise_scores.R:43-58`)\n   - Verifies metrics attribute is preserved\n   - Tests error handling when metrics is NULL\n   - Tests warnings when metric columns are renamed\n\n---\n\n### 6. **`R/summarise_scores.R` - Complete File**\n**File path:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/summarise_scores.R` (77 lines total)\n\n**Documentation (lines 1-49):**\n- @title: \"Summarise scores as produced by score()\"\n- @description: Explains that it relies on `metrics` attribute to identify score columns\n- Warns about renaming scores and needing to update the `metrics` attribute manually\n- @param scores: An object of class `scores`\n- @param by: Character vector with column names to summarise by (default: \"model\")\n- @param fun: Function for summarising (default: `mean`)\n- @param ...: Additional parameters to pass to fun\n- @return: A data.table with summarised scores\n- Includes comprehensive examples\n- @export\n- @importFrom checkmate: assert_subset, assert_function, test_subset, assert_data_frame\n- @keywords scoring\n\n**Implementation (lines 51-71):**\n- Input validation\n- Extracts metrics via `get_metrics.scores(scores, error = TRUE)`\n- Uses pattern matching: `.SDcols = colnames(scores) %like% paste(metrics, collapse = \"|\")`\n- Applies function by groups specified in `by` parameter\n- **Preserves metrics attribute:** Line 69\n- Returns `scores[]`\n\n**Alias (lines 73-76):**\n- Exports `summarize_scores` as American English alias\n- `summarize_scores <- summarise_scores`\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Scores Object Class Structure**\n\nFrom test results (`test-score.R:6-10`):\n```\nExpected class: c(\"scores\", \"data.table\", \"data.frame\")\n```\n\n**Class hierarchy:**\n- Primary: `scores` (custom class)\n- Secondary: `data.table` (from `as.data.table()`)\n- Tertiary: `data.frame` (inherited from data.table)\n\n**Associated attributes:**\n- `metrics`: Character vector of metric column names\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Key Files:\n\n| File | Purpose | Key Content |\n|------|---------|------------|\n| `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-scores.R` | Core scores class definition | `new_scores()`, `as_scores()`, `assert_scores()`, `[.scores`, `get_metrics.scores()` |\n| `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast.R` | Forecast class with print method | `print.forecast()` (lines 400-465) -

Print-Related Tests and Snapshots\n\n**File**: `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/test-class-forecast.R` (lines 122-174)\n\n**Print Method Tests**:\n```r\ntest_that(\"print() works on forecast_* objects\", {\n  # Lines 124-152: Tests print() on all forecast types\n  expect_snapshot(print(dat))  # Line 141\n  # Check print.data.table compatibility\n  output_original <- suppressMessages(capture.output(print(dat)))\n  output_test <- suppressMessages(capture.output(print(data.table(dat))))\n  expect_contains(output_original, output_test)  # Line 150\n})\n\ntest_that(\"print() throws the expected messages\", {\n  # Lines 154-174: Tests error messages during print\n  expect_message(capture.output(print(test)), \n                 \"Could not determine forecast type due to error in validation.\")\n})\n```\n\n**Snapshot Files** (markdown format):\n\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/_snaps/class-forecast.md` (42,654 bytes)\n  - Contains 4 test snapshots for each forecast type (binary, quantile, point, sample)\n  - Shows actual print output with forecast type and forecast unit information\n  - Example snapshot section (lines 3-37):\n    ```\n    Code: print(dat)\n    Message:\n      Forecast type: binary\n      Forecast unit:\n      location, location_name, target_end_date, target_type, forecast_date, model,\n      and horizon\n    Output: [actual data.table print]\n    ```\n\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/_snaps/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.md` (6,601 bytes)\n  - Test: `as_forecast_multivariate_sample() creates expected structure` (lines 1-68)\n  - Test: `score.forecast_sample_multivariate() creates expected output structure` (lines 69-160)\n  - Uses both `expect_snapshot(print(result))` and `expect_snapshot({ cat(...) })`\n\n**Print Implementation**:\n\n**File**: `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast.R` (lines 415-465)\n\n```r\nprint.forecast <- function(x, ...) {\n  # Lines 418-441: Get and print forecast type\n  forecast_type <- try(do.call(get_forecast_type, list(forecast = x)), silent = TRUE)\n  if (inherits(forecast_type, \"try-error\")) {\n    cli_inform(c(\"!\" = \"Could not determine forecast type due to error in validation.\"))\n  } else {\n    cli_text(col_blue(\"Forecast type: \"), \"{forecast_type}\")\n  }\n  \n  # Lines 443-458: Get and print forecast unit\n  forecast_unit <- try(do.call(get_forecast_unit, list(data = x)), silent = TRUE)\n  if (inherits(forecast_unit, \"try-error\")) {\n    cli_inform(c(\"!\" = \"Could not determine forecast unit.\"))\n  } else {\n    cli_text(col_blue(\"Forecast unit:\"))\n    cli_text(\"{forecast_unit}\")\n  }\n  \n  cat(\"\\n\")\n  NextMethod()  # Delegates to print.data.table\n  return(invisible(x))\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Scores Class Definition\n\n**File**: `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-scores.R` (143 lines)\n\n**Key Components**:\n- `new_scores()` (lines 20-25): Constructor function\n  - Returns object with class `c(\"scores\", \"data.table\", \"data.frame\")`\n  - Attaches `metrics` attribute\n\n- `as_scores()` (lines 34-40): Validation wrapper\n  - Calls `new_scores()` and validates result\n\n- `assert_scores()` (lines 51-58): Validator function\n  - Checks for class and `metrics` attribute\n  - Calls `get_metrics.scores(scores, error = TRUE)`\n\n- `[.scores` method (lines 63-71): Subsetting operator\n  - Preserves `metrics` attribute after subsetting\n  - Works with both data.table and data.frame results\n\n- `get_metrics.scores()` (lines 113-142): Attribute accessor\n  - Retrieves and validates `metrics` attribute\n  - Issues `cli_warn()` if metrics columns are missing\n  - Returns character vector of metric names\n\n### 7. Multivariate Sample Tests\n\n**File**: `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R` (lines 23-53)\n\n**Key Test**:\n```r\ntest_that(\"as_forecast_multivariate_sample() creates expected structure\", {\n  result <- as_forecast_multivariate_sample(...)\n  \n  # Snapshot the print output\n  expect_snapshot(print(result))  # Line 41\n  \n  # Snapshot structure details\n  expect_snapshot({\n    cat(\"Class:\", class(result), \"\\n\")\n    cat(\"Forecast type:\", scoringutils:::get_forecast_type(result), \"\\n\")\n    cat(\"Forecast unit:\", toString(get_forecast_unit(result)), \"\\n\")\n    cat(\"Number of rows:\", nrow(result), \"\\n\")\n    cat(\"Number of columns:\", ncol(result), \"\\n\")\n    cat(\"Column names:\", toString(names(result)), \"\\n\")\n    cat(\"Number of unique groups:\", length(unique(result$.mv_group_id)), \"\\n\")\n  })\n})\n```\n\nAlso tests scoring: `score.forecast_sample_multivariate()` (lines 173-199)\n\n### 8. Other Print-Related Tests\n\n**test-class-forecast-quantile.R** (line 428):\n```r\nexpect_output(print(pit_quantile))\n```\n\n**test-metrics.R** (lines 108-109):\n- Tests output from custom metrics using `purrr::partial()`\n- Uses `expect_output()` to validate print function behavior\n\n### 9. Summary of Key Testing Patterns for Scores\n\n1. **Class Assertions**: Always use `expect_s3_class(..., exact = TRUE)` with full class vector\n2. **Attribute Preservation**: Test that subsetting `[` preserves the `metrics` attribute\n3. **Error Messages**: Use `expect_error()` with specific message matching\n4. **Warnings**: Validate deprecation/change warnings with `expect_warning()`\n5. **Snapshot Testing**: Used for print output validation and complex data structures\n6. **Output Capture**: Use `suppressMessages(capture.output(print(...)))` for print testing\n7. **Data.table Compatibility**: Ensure data.table print methods are compatible\n\nAll absolute file paths are listed above in the report."}],"totalDurationMs":84156,"totalTokens":46537,"totalToolUseCount":32,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1547,"cache_read_input_tokens":42145,"output_tokens":2845,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1547,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[]}}}

Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-class-scores.R` (existing)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat + data.table fixtures; `expect_snapshot()` for print output; `expect_s3_class()` for class checks; pre-computed `scores_*` objects in `setup.R` (e.g., `scores_quantile`, `scores_binary`, `scores_point`, `scores_sample_continuous`); `suppressMessages(capture.output(print(...)))` pattern for isolating print output; `cli_text()` / `cli_inform()` used for formatted messages in existing `print.forecast()`.\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"print.scores() outputs metrics and vignette link\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core issue — scores objects have no custom print method, so no link to score definitions is shown\n**Setup**:\n- Use pre-computed `scores_quantile` from `setup.R`\n**Action**:\n- Call `print(scores_quantile)` and capture its output/messages\n**Expected**:\n- Output contains the names of the metrics used (retrieved from the `metrics` attribute), e.g., \"wis\", \"overprediction\", \"underprediction\", etc.\n- Output contains a link or reference to the scoring rules vignette (e.g., text matching `\"scoring-rules\"` or the vignette URL `https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/articles/scoring-rules.html`)\n- The underlying data.table content is still printed (i.e., `NextMethod()` is called, so the tabular data appears in the output)\n- Use `expect_snapshot(print(scores_quantile))` to pin the exact formatted output\n**Fails now because**:\n- No `print.scores()` method exists. `print()` dispatches directly to `print.data.table()`, which shows only the raw table with no metrics summary or vignette link.\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"print.scores() works for all forecast types\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: ensures the print method works across all score object types, not just one\n**Setup**:\n- Use all pre-computed scores objects from `setup.R`: `scores_quantile`, `scores_binary`, `scores_point`, `scores_sample_continuous`, `scores_sample_discrete`, `scores_nominal`\n**Action**:\n- Call `print()` on each scores object\n**Expected**:\n- Each call completes without error or unexpected warnings\n- Use `expect_no_condition()` wrapping `capture.output(print(scores_obj))` for each (or `expect_snapshot()` for one representative type)\n- Each output includes the metrics names relevant to its forecast type (e.g., `scores_binary` should mention `\"brier_score\"`, `scores_point` should mention `\"ae_point\"`)\n**Fails now because**:\n- No `print.scores()` method exists; there is no custom output to validate.\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"print.scores() returns x invisibly\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: standard R print method contract — print should return the object invisibly\n**Setup**:\n- Use `scores_quantile` from `setup.R`\n**Action**:\n- Capture the return value: `ret <- capture.output(result <- print(scores_quantile))` (inside `suppressMessages()`)\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_identical(result, scores_quantile)` — the returned object is identical to the input\n- The return is invisible (following the convention from `print.forecast()` which does `return(invisible(x))`)\n**Fails now because**:\n- `print.data.table()` returns `x` invisibly by default, so this test might pass even now. However, this test ensures the contract is maintained when the new `print.scores()` method is added — it's a regression guard.\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"print.scores() includes data.table output\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: ensures the new print method still delegates to data.table printing (via `NextMethod()`) so users still see their data\n**Setup**:\n- Use `scores_quantile` from `setup.R`\n**Action**:\n- Capture output from the new `print.scores()`: `output_scores <- suppressMessages(capture.output(print(scores_quantile)))`\n- Capture output from plain data.table print: `output_dt <- capture.output(print(data.table::as.data.table(scores_quantile)))`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_true(all(output_dt %in% output_scores))` — all lines from the data.table print appear in the scores print output\n- This mirrors the existing pattern from `print.forecast()` tests at `test-class-forecast.R:147-150`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Currently `print()` on a scores object IS `print.data.table()` directly, so this would pass trivially. After implementing `print.scores()`, this test ensures `NextMethod()` is called and data.table output is preserved.\n\n### Test 5: test_that(\"print.scores() handles missing metrics attribute gracefully\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: edge case where the `metrics` attribute has been stripped (e.g., by operations that don't preserve attributes)\n**Setup**:\n- Create a scores object and remove its metrics attribute: `ex <- data.table::copy(scores_quantile); attr(ex, \"metrics\") <- NULL`\n- Note: `ex` still has class `\"scores\"` so `print.scores()` would dispatch\n**Action**:\n- Call `print(ex)` wrapped in output capture\n**Expected**:\n- The print call should not error. It should either:\n  - Show a warning/message that metrics attribute is missing (similar to how `get_metrics.scores()` handles this), OR\n  - Simply skip the metrics display and still print the underlying data.table\n- Use `expect_no_error(capture.output(print(ex)))` at minimum\n**Fails now because**:\n- No `print.scores()` method exists, so this edge case is untested. After implementation, this ensures the method handles degraded objects gracefully rather than crashing.\n\n### Test 6: test_that(\"print.scores() handles renamed metric columns with warning\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: edge case where metric columns have been renamed, causing mismatch with `metrics` attribute\n**Setup**:\n- Copy a scores object and rename a metric column: `ex <- data.table::copy(scores_sample_continuous); data.table::setnames(ex, old = \"crps\", new = \"changed\")`\n- The `metrics` attribute still contains `\"crps\"` but the column is now `\"changed\"`\n**Action**:\n- Call `print(ex)` wrapped in output capture\n**Expected**:\n- A warning should be emitted about the mismatch (inheriting from `get_metrics.scores()` behavior which already warns: `\"scores have been previously computed, but are no longer column names\"`)\n- The print call should still complete without error\n- Use `expect_warning(capture.output(print(ex)), \"scores have been previously computed\")`\n**Fails now because**:\n- No `print.scores()` method exists. The mismatch warning from `get_metrics.scores()` is never triggered during printing because print doesn't call `get_metrics.scores()`.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":274,"cache_read_input_tokens":58767,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":274},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1fc5fb10-f2a5-47d4-8b22-65be7c8cc266","uuid":"cbd6561a-3f02-45aa-a4e7-c37fd7e71224"}

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

If not, close the issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1064 | Pre-ranking for multivariate calibration assessment | | 2026-01-30 | feature | medium | large | no | No pre-ranking or multivariate calibration diagnostics exist in the codebase. The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output. Update test snapshots. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1026 | as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile | enhancement | 2025-07-13 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples. Requires design decision on approximation method and potential new package dependency. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1022 | Let `get_pairwise_comparison()` run with two models? | | 2025-07-03 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.
