Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    33→| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    34→| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    42→| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature). If yes, run `usethis::use_release_issue()` and proceed with CRAN submission. If not, close the issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1064 | Pre-ranking for multivariate calibration assessment | | 2026-01-30 | feature | medium | large | no | No pre-ranking or multivariate calibration diagnostics exist in the codebase. The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al. (2008) as calibration diagnostics for multivariate forecasts, after resolving the API design choice with maintainers. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1057 | Revise README to remove news about the package rewrite | documentation | 2026-01-29 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Open, no assignee. The rewrite messaging and Google Drive paper links appear in 4 locations in README.Rmd. Mechanical edits are straightforward but replacement text requires editorial decisions about where to point users for documentation. | Loosely related to #810 (pkgdown for dev docs) and #759 (future of scoringutils.Rmd vignette). | Edit `README.Rmd` to remove/soften the \"major re-write\" paragraph and replace Google Drive paper links with pointers to package vignettes/docs, then re-render README.md. Confirm preferred documentation hierarchy with maintainers first. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1055 | Model confidence sets | feature request | 2026-01-19 | feature | medium | large | no | Design phase — methodology not yet agreed upon. 6 comments with active debate. Naive pairwise p-value approach acknowledged as incomplete. Three alternatives discussed: Hansen et al. MCS, novel extension for incomplete sets, Bayesian approach. No consensus reached. | Relates to #750 (p-value computation refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #37 (Diebold-Mariano test), #1022 (two-model pairwise). | Resolve design consensus on which MCS methodology to implement (Hansen et al. on complete sets, novel incomplete-set extension, or Bayesian), then implement `get_model_confidence_set()` building on existing pairwise comparison infrastructure. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1046 | multivariate scoring in scoring rules vignette | documentation | 2025-11-04 | documentation | low | small | partially | Open, agreed upon by maintainers. The scoring-rules vignette has zero mentions of multivariate scoring. A dedicated multivariate vignette already exists. Only a cross-reference and brief section are missing. | None. All underlying code and the dedicated multivariate vignette already exist. | Add a short section to `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd` describing the energy score for multivariate forecasts and cross-linking to the existing `scoring-multivariate-forecasts` vignette. No code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1044 | Remove the commented out vignette code. | | 2025-09-23 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Two HTML comment blocks remain: a WIP \"Details on the grouping\" section in `scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` (lines 88-102) and a ~50-line PIT/Calibration section in `scoring-rules.Rmd` (lines 444-493). Originated from PR #998 review comment. | None. | Delete the two HTML-commented-out code blocks from `vignettes/scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` and `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd`. Optionally confirm with maintainers whether the PIT/Calibration text should be preserved elsewhere. | N/A | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1043 | Update print method for multivariate forecasts to show `joint_across` | | 2025-09-21 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output. Update test snapshots. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1026 | as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile | enhancement | 2025-07-13 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples. Requires design decision on approximation method and potential new package dependency. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1022 | Let `get_pairwise_comparison()` run with two models? | | 2025-07-03 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL.

The issue concerns the one-to-one correspondence between quantile-format and interval-format metric functions. Currently: `interval_score()` is internal (not exported), called by `wis()` after `quantile_to_interval()` conversion. Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy.

(2) Optionally evaluate adding `matrixStats` for 3 `apply()` calls — lower value, separate decision. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n65:| 811 | Should `score()`/`apply_metrics()` return warning about failed metrics in a batch? | enhancement | 2024-05-07 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `run_safely()` in `R/score.R:210` uses `try()` + immediate `cli_warn()` per failed metric. No batching/deferring mechanism exists. Failed metrics silently dropped from `scores` object via `as_scores()` filtering. Blog post on deferred errors referenced in issue. Only 1 comment from maintainer (\"I like this idea\"). | None blocking. Tangentially related to #823 (reduce `try()`) and #382 (metric/column name clash warnings). | Modify `apply_metrics()`/`run_safely()` to collect error messages in a list during the `lapply` loop, then emit a single batched `cli_warn()` summarizing all failed metrics at the end.

Only 12 instances use Hugo's backtick fix (`\\`!\\` =`). The fix is mechanical: replace `\"!\" =` with `` `!` = `` inside cli condition calls, then remove the `nolint` annotations. Additional `object_usage_linter` suppressions (14 blocks) exist for `.data[...]` patterns in data.table code — these need separate handling. No work done on this issue since filing. | Prerequisite for #808 (run lintr everywhere). Related to PR #583 (which introduced the cli pattern). | Replace all `\"!\" =`, `\"i\" =`, `\"x\" =`, `\"v\" =` with backtick-quoted equivalents (`` `!` = ``, etc.) in `cli_abort()`/`cli_warn()` calls across ~20 R/ files, then delete the corresponding `#nolint start`/`#nolint end` blocks.

Three generics currently lump methods with differing arguments onto one `@rdname` page: `as_forecast_quantile` (`.forecast_sample` has different args), `as_forecast_point` (`.forecast_quantile`), and `get_pit_histogram` (`.forecast_sample` has extra args). Renders a confusing flat argument list. | None. | Remove shared `@rdname` tags for S3 methods whose arguments differ from the generic (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`, `as_forecast_point.forecast_quantile`, `get_pit_histogram.forecast_sample`) and give each its own documentation page with proper title and description. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n71:| 785 | Small updates to the scoring rules Vignette | documentation | 2024-04-10 | documentation | low | small | yes | Still relevant.

PR #994 added `test_type = NULL` but didn't address the `...` pattern. #750 (split out p-values) was deferred. | Loosely related to #750 (if p-values split out, this becomes moot — but #750 deferred indefinitely). No hard blockers. | Promote `test_type`, `one_sided`, and `n_permutations` from `...` to explicit named arguments in `get_pairwise_comparisons()` and `add_relative_skill()`, improving API discoverability.

No code warns when 0/1 factor levels are in counterintuitive order (e.g., `levels = c(1, 0)` making `0` the reference level). `assert_input_binary()` only validates factor with 2 levels and predicted in [0,1].
