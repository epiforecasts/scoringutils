Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    33→| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    34→| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    42→| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

Smaller values are better.\n    61→#'\n    62→#' As the name suggest the score assumes that a forecast comes in the form of\n    63→#' one or multiple central prediction intervals. A prediction interval is\n    64→#' characterised by a lower and an upper bound formed by a pair of predictive\n    65→#' quantiles. For example, a 50% central prediction interval is formed by the\n    66→#' 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles of the predictive distribution.\n    67→#'\n    68→#' **Interval score**\n    69→#'\n    70→#' The interval score (IS) is the sum of three components:\n    71→#' overprediction, underprediction and dispersion.

For a 90% prediction interval, for example,\n    96→#' \\eqn{\\alpha}{alpha} is equal to 0.1. No specific distribution is assumed,\n    97→#' but the interval formed by the quantiles has to be symmetric around the\n    98→#' median (i.e you can't use the 0.1 quantile as the lower bound and the 0.7\n    99→#' quantile as the upper bound).\n   100→#' Non-symmetric quantiles can be scored using the function [quantile_score()].\n   101→#'\n   102→#' For a set of \\eqn{k = 1, \\dots, K} prediction intervals and the median\n   103→#' \\eqn{m}, we can compute a weighted interval score (WIS) as the sum of the\n   104→#' interval scores for individual intervals:\n   105→#' \\deqn{\n   106→#' \\text{WIS}_{\\alpha_{\\{0:K\\}}}(F, y) = \\frac{1}{K + 1/2}\n   107→#' \\times \\left(w_0 \\times |y - m| + \\sum_{k=1}^{K}\n   108→#' \\left\\{ w_k \\times \\text{IS}_{\\alpha_k}(F, y) \\right\\}\\right)\n   109→#' }{\n   110→#' }\n   111→#'\n   112→#' The individual scores are usually weighted with\n   113→#' \\eqn{w_k = \\frac{\\alpha_k}{2}}{alpha_k / 2}. This weight ensures that\n   114→#' for an increasing number of equally spaced quantiles, the WIS\n   115→#' converges to the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS).\n   116→#'\n   117→#' **Quantile score**\n   118→#'\n   119→#' In addition to the interval score, there also exists a quantile score (QS)\n   120→#' (see [quantile_score()]), which is equal to the so-called pinball loss.\n   121→#' The quantile score can be computed for a single quantile (whereas the\n   122→#' interval score requires two quantiles that form an interval). However,\n   123→#' the intuitive decomposition into overprediction, underprediction and\n   124→#' dispersion does not exist for the quantile score.\n   125→#'\n   126→#' **Two versions of the weighted interval score**\n   127→#'\n   128→#' There are two ways to conceptualise the weighted interval score across\n   129→#' several quantiles / prediction intervals and the median.\n   130→#'\n   131→#' In one view, you would treat the WIS as the average of quantile scores (and\n   132→#' the median as 0.5-quantile) (this is the default for `wis()`). In another\n   133→#' view, you would treat the WIS as the average of several interval scores +\n   134→#' the difference between the observed value and median forecast. The effect of\n   135→#' that is that in contrast to the first view, the median has twice as much\n   136→#' weight (because it is weighted like a prediction interval, rather than like\n   137→#' a single quantile). Both are valid ways to conceptualise the WIS and you\n   138→#' can control the behaviour with the `count_median_twice`-argument.\n   139→#'\n   140→#' **WIS components**:\n   141→#' WIS components can be computed individually using the functions\n   142→#' `overprediction`, `underprediction`, and `dispersion.`\n   143→#'\n   144→#' @inheritParams interval_score\n   145→#' @param observed Numeric vector of size n with the observed values.\n   146→#' @param predicted Numeric nxN matrix of predictive\n   147→#'   quantiles, n (number of rows) being the number of forecasts (corresponding\n   148→#'   to the number of observed values) and N\n   149→#'   (number of columns) the number of quantiles per forecast.\n   150→#'   If `observed` is just a single number, then predicted can just be a\n   151→#'   vector of size N.\n   152→#' @param quantile_level Vector of of size N with the quantile levels\n   153→#'   for which predictions were made.\n   154→#' @param count_median_twice If TRUE, count the median twice in the score.\n   155→#' @param na.rm If TRUE, ignore NA values when computing the score.\n   156→#' @importFrom stats weighted.mean\n   157→#' @importFrom checkmate assert_logical\n   158→#' @inheritSection illustration-input-metric-quantile Input format\n   159→#' @return\n   160→#' `wis()`: a numeric vector with WIS values of size n (one per observation),\n   161→#' or a list with separate entries if `separate_results` is `TRUE`.\n   162→#' @export\n   163→#' @references\n   164→#' Evaluating epidemic forecasts in an interval format,\n   165→#' Johannes Bracher, Evan L.

RELATED ISSUE DOCUMENTATION**\n\nFile: `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/.ralph/issues/895-quantile-prediction-order.md`\n\n**Key Requirements**:\n1. Create `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` — user-facing diagnostic function\n2. Add warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` when non-monotonic forecasts detected\n3. Create internal helper `check_monotonicity()` following the pattern of `check_duplicates()`\n\n**Test Specifications** (12 test cases defined):\n1. Returns empty data.table for well-formed quantile forecasts\n2. Detects predictions that decrease with increasing quantile level\n3. Handles multiple forecast units with mixed monotonicity\n4. Works with `counts` argument\n5. Accepts custom `forecast_unit` argument\n6. Returns expected class (data.table)\n7. Works with plain data.frame input\n8. `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` warns about non-monotonic predictions\n9. Does not warn for well-formed data\n10. Suppresses warning when `verbose = FALSE`\n11. `score()` works end-to-end excluding bias metrics\n12. Handles equal predictions at adjacent quantile levels (flat segments OK)\n\n---\n\n### **8. KEY CODE PATTERNS TO FOLLOW**\n\n#### **Data Table Operations**:\n```r\n# Grouping and ordering\ndata[, new_col := .N, by = forecast_unit]\nsetorderv(data, cols = c(forecast_unit, \"quantile_level\", \"predicted\"))\n\n# Filtering\nresult <- data[scoringutils_InternalCheck > 0]\n\n# Summary aggregation\nresult <- result[, .(count = .N), by = forecast_unit]\n```\n\n#### **CLI Messages**:\n```r\n# Import\nimportFrom cli cli_warn cli_abort cli_inform\n\n# Usage\ncli_warn(c(\n  \"!\" = \"Warning message with {.val variable} formatting\"\n))\n\ncli_abort(c(\n  \"!\" = \"Error message with {.val variable} formatting\"\n))\n\ncli_inform(c(\n  \"i\" = \"Informational message\"\n))\n```\n\n#### **Returning Data**:\n```r\n# Always return with [] to force printing/stripping class temporarily\nreturn(data[])\n```\n\n---\n\n### **9. QUANTILE LEVEL ORDERING AND PREDICTIONS**\n\nFrom the existing `bias_quantile_single_vector()` check (line 493-504):\n\n```r\norder <- order(quantile_level)\npredicted <- predicted[order]  # REORDER by quantile_level\nif (!all(diff(predicted) >= 0)) {\n  # Violation: predicted is DECREASING somewhere\n  cli_abort(\"Predictions must not be decreasing with increasing quantile level.\")\n}\n```\n\n**Critical Implementation Detail**: \n- Within a forecast unit, predictions must be sorted by `quantile_level`\n- Then check `diff(predicted) >= 0` (all differences must be non-negative)\n- Allows equality (flat segments), only rejects strictly decreasing values\n\n---\n\n### **10.

RELATED ISSUE DOCUMENTATION**\n\nFile: `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/.ralph/issues/895-quantile-prediction-order.md`\n\n**Key Requirements**:\n1. Create `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` — user-facing diagnostic function\n2. Add warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` when non-monotonic forecasts detected\n3. Create internal helper `check_monotonicity()` following the pattern of `check_duplicates()`\n\n**Test Specifications** (12 test cases defined):\n1. Returns empty data.table for well-formed quantile forecasts\n2. Detects predictions that decrease with increasing quantile level\n3. Handles multiple forecast units with mixed monotonicity\n4. Works with `counts` argument\n5. Accepts custom `forecast_unit` argument\n6. Returns expected class (data.table)\n7. Works with plain data.frame input\n8. `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` warns about non-monotonic predictions\n9. Does not warn for well-formed data\n10. Suppresses warning when `verbose = FALSE`\n11. `score()` works end-to-end excluding bias metrics\n12. Handles equal predictions at adjacent quantile levels (flat segments OK)\n\n---\n\n### **8. KEY CODE PATTERNS TO FOLLOW**\n\n#### **Data Table Operations**:\n```r\n# Grouping and ordering\ndata[, new_col := .N, by = forecast_unit]\nsetorderv(data, cols = c(forecast_unit, \"quantile_level\", \"predicted\"))\n\n# Filtering\nresult <- data[scoringutils_InternalCheck > 0]\n\n# Summary aggregation\nresult <- result[, .(count = .N), by = forecast_unit]\n```\n\n#### **CLI Messages**:\n```r\n# Import\nimportFrom cli cli_warn cli_abort cli_inform\n\n# Usage\ncli_warn(c(\n  \"!\" = \"Warning message with {.val variable} formatting\"\n))\n\ncli_abort(c(\n  \"!\" = \"Error message with {.val variable} formatting\"\n))\n\ncli_inform(c(\n  \"i\" = \"Informational message\"\n))\n```\n\n#### **Returning Data**:\n```r\n# Always return with [] to force printing/stripping class temporarily\nreturn(data[])\n```\n\n---\n\n### **9. QUANTILE LEVEL ORDERING AND PREDICTIONS**\n\nFrom the existing `bias_quantile_single_vector()` check (line 493-504):\n\n```r\norder <- order(quantile_level)\npredicted <- predicted[order]  # REORDER by quantile_level\nif (!all(diff(predicted) >= 0)) {\n  # Violation: predicted is DECREASING somewhere\n  cli_abort(\"Predictions must not be decreasing with increasing quantile level.\")\n}\n```\n\n**Critical Implementation Detail**: \n- Within a forecast unit, predictions must be sorted by `quantile_level`\n- Then check `diff(predicted) >= 0` (all differences must be non-negative)\n- Allows equality (flat segments), only rejects strictly decreasing values\n\n---\n\n### **10.

Resolves both #895 and #412.\n- **Status Note**: Monotonicity check only exists deep in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (metrics-quantile.R:495) as a hard error. No early warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. No user-facing diagnostic function. Issue #412 is the maintainer-created parent with an agreed plan (steps 1 and 3 not done).\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test files**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (existing) and `tests/testthat/test-get-duplicate-forecasts.R` (existing, to add sibling tests for `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat with data.table fixtures; `example_quantile` dataset used extensively; `expect_no_condition()` for passing cases, `expect_error()`/`expect_warning()` for failing cases; `suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(...))` around `as_forecast_quantile()` calls; setup.R pre-computes `scores_quantile` and `metrics_no_cov`; no helper-*.R files exist\n\n## Implementation Context\n\nThe fix has three parts:\n1. **New function `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`** — user-facing diagnostic, modeled on `get_duplicate_forecasts()` (in `R/get-duplicate-forecasts.R`). Takes a forecast object (or data with `quantile_level` and `predicted` columns), groups by forecast unit, orders by `quantile_level` within each group, and returns rows where `predicted` decreases as `quantile_level` increases.\n2. **Warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`** — after the existing 4 checks (line 84-87 of `R/class-forecast-quantile.R`), add a call that detects non-monotonic forecasts and emits `cli_warn()` (not `cli_abort()`), guarded by `verbose`.\n3. **Internal helper `check_monotonicity()`** — analogous to `check_duplicates()`, calls `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` and returns `TRUE` or an error message string. Used by `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`.\n\n---\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() returns empty data.table for well-formed quantile forecasts\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: baseline correctness — well-formed data should produce no results\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (or a new `test-get-non-monotonic-forecasts.R` following the `test-get-duplicate-forecasts.R` naming pattern)\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` directly (built-in dataset with well-formed quantile forecasts)\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(example_quantile)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_identical(nrow(get_non_monotonic_forecasts(example_quantile)), 0L)` — no rows returned\n- Result should be a `data.table`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` does not exist yet; call will error with \"could not find function\"\n\n---\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() detects predictions that decrease with increasing quantile level\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core bug — non-monotonic predictions are not flagged until deep inside `bias_quantile()`\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Create a minimal quantile forecast data.table with one forecast unit having non-monotonic predictions:\n  ```\n  data.table(\n    model = \"model1\",\n    date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"),\n    observed = 5,\n    quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),\n    predicted = c(3, 7, 4)    # 7 > 4 violates monotonicity at q=0.75\n  )\n  ```\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile` using `suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(as_forecast_quantile(...)))`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(data)` on the constructed data\n**Expected**:\n- Result has `nrow > 0` — the non-monotonic forecast unit is returned\n- The returned rows should contain the forecast unit where the violation occurs (model=\"model1\", date=\"2020-01-01\")\n- All quantile rows for that forecast unit should be included (so the user can see the full picture), i.e., `nrow(result) == 3`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n\n---\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() handles multiple forecast units with mixed monotonicity\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: edge case — only some forecast units are non-monotonic; function should return only the bad ones\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Create a data.table with two forecast units:\n  -

However, the WIS metric itself does not require monotonicity and should compute fine.

Create a user-facing `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` helper to identify affected rows (resolving both #412 and #895).\n- **Status Note**: Monotonicity check only exists deep in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (metrics-quantile.R:495) as a hard error. No early warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. No user-facing diagnostic function. Issue #412 is the maintainer-created parent with an agreed plan (steps 1 and 3 not done).\n\n## Relationship to #895\n\nIssue #895 is a near-duplicate of #412. Both require the same implementation:\n1. A user-facing `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` helper function\n2. A warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` for non-monotonic predictions\n3. An internal `check_monotonicity()` helper (analogous to `check_duplicates()`)\n\n**Comprehensive test specifications already exist in `.ralph/issues/895-quantile-prediction-order.md`** (12 test cases). The tests below focus specifically on #412's original ask: the three-part plan from the issue comments:\n- (a) Write a helper function to check monotonicity\n- (b) Enforce it in `bias_quantile()` as it's needed there (already done — hard error at `metrics-quantile.R:495`)\n- (c) Check + warn in `validate_forecast()` (now `assert_forecast()`)\n\nThe tests below complement #895's specs by focusing on the `assert_forecast` integration and `bias_quantile` enforcement that #412 specifically calls out. Any test that duplicates #895 is noted.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test files**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (existing), `tests/testthat/test-metrics-quantile.R` (existing)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat with data.table fixtures; `example_quantile` used as baseline; `expect_no_condition()` for clean cases; `expect_error()`/`expect_warning()` with regex patterns for failures; `suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(...))` wrappers around `as_forecast_quantile()` calls; `expect_silent()` for functions that should produce no output; `setup.R` pre-computes `scores_quantile` etc.\n\n---\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"assert_forecast.forecast_quantile() warns when predictions decrease with increasing quantile level\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core gap — `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` (R/class-forecast-quantile.R:81-89) has no monotonicity check; non-monotonic data silently passes validation and only errors deep inside `bias_quantile_single_vector()` at scoring time\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R`\n**Setup**:\n- Create a minimal data.table with non-monotonic predictions:\n  ```\n  data.table(\n    model = \"model1\",\n    date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"),\n    observed = 5,\n    quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),\n    predicted = c(3, 7, 4)      # 7 > 4 violates monotonicity\n  )\n  ```\n**Action**:\n- Call `as_forecast_quantile(data)` which internally invokes `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_warning(as_forecast_quantile(data), \"non-monotonic|decreasing|Predictions must not be decreasing\")` — a warning (NOT error) is emitted\n- The function should still return a valid `forecast_quantile` object (non-monotonic data is suspicious but not fatal at the validation stage)\n- The warning message should mention `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` so users know how to diagnose further\n**Fails now because**:\n- `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` only checks: (1) `quantile_level` column exists, (2) generic forecast assertions, (3) forecast type matches, (4) quantile_level is numeric in [0,1]. No monotonicity check. Non-monotonic data passes silently.\n\n*Note*: Overlaps with #895 Test 8. Kept here because this is the central ask of #412.\n\n---\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"assert_forecast.forecast_quantile() does not warn for well-formed monotonic predictions\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: regression guard — the new monotonicity check must not produce false positives on valid data\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R`\n**Setup**:\n- Use `na.omit(data.table::copy(example_quantile))` — the built-in dataset with well-formed, monotonic predictions\n**Action**:\n- Call `as_forecast_quantile(data)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_no_condition(as_forecast_quantile(data))` — no warnings, messages, or errors\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS both before and after the fix. It serves as a regression guard to confirm that well-formed data never triggers the new warning.\n\n*Note*: Overlaps with #895 Test 9.\n\n---\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"assert_forecast.forecast_quantile() respects verbose = FALSE for monotonicity warning\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the `verbose` parameter pattern — per the issue discussion, the warning should be suppressible\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R`\n**Setup**:\n- Create non-monotonic data (same as Test 1)\n- First convert to `forecast_quantile` while suppressing the expected warning\n**Action**:\n- Call `assert_forecast(forecast_obj, verbose = FALSE)` on the non-monotonic object\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_no_condition(assert_forecast(forecast_obj, verbose = FALSE))` — warning suppressed when `verbose = FALSE`\n- This follows the existing pattern where `assert_forecast_generic()` guards its messages behind the `verbose` flag\n**Fails now because**:\n- No monotonicity check exists yet, so `verbose` has no effect on a non-existent check\n\n*Note*: Overlaps with #895 Test 10.\n\n---\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"bias_quantile() errors on predictions that decrease with increasing quantile level\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: confirms that the existing hard error in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (metrics-quantile.R:495) is preserved after the fix — the assert_forecast warning should NOT replace this error\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-metrics-quantile.R`\n**Setup**:\n- `predicted <- c(1, 2, 4, 3)` — prediction at q=0.9 (3) is less than q=0.5 (4)\n- `quantiles <- c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.9)`\n- `observed <- 3`\n**Action**:\n- Call `bias_quantile(observed = 3, predicted, quantiles)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_error(bias_quantile(observed = 3, predicted, quantiles), \"Predictions must not be decreasing with increasing quantile level\")` — hard error preserved\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS both before and after the fix. It already exists at `test-metrics-quantile.R:852-861`. Including it here to document that the #412 plan explicitly says \"enforce it in `bias_quantile()` as it's needed there\" — which is already done.\n\n---\n\n### Test 5: test_that(\"bias_quantile() succeeds when quantile levels are unordered but predictions are monotonic after sorting\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: edge case — `bias_quantile_single_vector()` sorts by `quantile_level` before checking monotonicity; if predictions track quantile_level order correctly but are passed in scrambled order, the function should succeed\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-metrics-quantile.R`\n**Setup**:\n- `predicted <- c(5, 2, 8)` — out of order, but after sorting by quantile_level = c(0.5, 0.25, 0.75) they become c(2, 5, 8) which is monotonic\n- `quantiles <- c(0.5, 0.25, 0.75)` — unsorted quantile levels\n- `observed <- 4`\n**Action**:\n- Call `bias_quantile(observed = 4, predicted, quantiles)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_silent(bias_quantile(observed = 4, predicted, quantiles))` — no error, because after sorting by quantile_level the predictions are non-decreasing\n- Returns a numeric bias value\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS both before and after the fix. It verifies that the existing sort-then-check logic in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` works correctly for scrambled input order.\n\n---\n\n### Test 6: test_that(\"score() with non-monotonic predictions warns at validation and handles bias metric gracefully\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the end-to-end user experience described in #412 — a user with non-monotonic predictions should get an early warning at `as_forecast_quantile()` time, and `score()` should handle the `bias_quantile` failure gracefully (via `run_safely()` converting the error to a warning)\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R`\n**Setup**:\n- Create a data.table with 2 forecast units: one monotonic, one non-monotonic\n  ```\n  rbind(\n    data.table(model = \"good\", date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"), observed = 5,\n               quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), predicted = c(2, 5, 8)),\n    data.table(model = \"bad\", date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"), observed = 5,\n               quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), predicted = c(3, 7, 4))\n  )\n  ```\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile` (expecting a warning about non-monotonic predictions)\n**Action**:\n- Call `score(forecast_obj)` with default metrics (which includes `bias_quantile`)\n**Expected**:\n- `score()` should NOT abort entirely — `run_safely()` converts the `bias_quantile` error to a per-metric warning\n- The resulting scores object should contain WIS and other metrics for both models\n- The `bias_quantile` metric should either be `NA` for the non-monotonic forecast unit or produce a per-metric warning\n- The overall result should be a valid `scores` object\n**Fails now because**:\n- Currently, `as_forecast_quantile()` emits no warning about the non-monotonic data. The user only discovers the problem inside `score()` when `bias_quantile` errors per forecast unit, with warnings from `run_safely()`. After the fix, the user gets early feedback at `as_forecast_quantile()` time.\n\n---\n\n### Test 7: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() identifies the specific forecast units with monotonicity violations\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the helper function request from #412's discussion (\"write a helper function to check that\")\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (or new `test-get-non-monotonic-forecasts.R`)\n**Setup**:\n- Create 3 forecast units:\n  - model=\"A\", date=\"2020-01-01\": `predicted = c(2, 5, 8)` — monotonic (OK)\n  - model=\"B\", date=\"2020-01-01\": `predicted = c(3, 7, 4)` — non-monotonic (BAD)\n  - model=\"C\", date=\"2020-01-01\": `predicted = c(1, 1, 1)` — flat/constant (OK — non-decreasing)\n- All with `quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)`, `observed = 5`\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile` (suppressing the warning)\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(data)`\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a `data.table` containing only the rows for model=\"B\" (the non-monotonic forecast unit)\n- `nrow(result) == 3` (all quantile rows for the affected unit, so the user can inspect the full picture)\n- model=\"A\" and model=\"C\" are NOT in the result\n- Model C with flat/constant predictions is correctly treated as non-decreasing (passes `diff(predicted) >= 0` check)\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` does not exist yet; call will error with \"could not find function\"\n\n*Note*: Overlaps with #895 Tests 2-3, 12.

It serves as a regression guard to confirm that well-formed data never triggers the new warning.\n\n*Note*: Overlaps with #895 Test 9.\n\n---\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"assert_forecast.forecast_quantile() respects verbose = FALSE for monotonicity warning\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the `verbose` parameter pattern — per the issue discussion, the warning should be suppressible\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R`\n**Setup**:\n- Create non-monotonic data (same as Test 1)\n- First convert to `forecast_quantile` while suppressing the expected warning\n**Action**:\n- Call `assert_forecast(forecast_obj, verbose = FALSE)` on the non-monotonic object\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_no_condition(assert_forecast(forecast_obj, verbose = FALSE))` — warning suppressed when `verbose = FALSE`\n- This follows the existing pattern where `assert_forecast_generic()` guards its messages behind the `verbose` flag\n**Fails now because**:\n- No monotonicity check exists yet, so `verbose` has no effect on a non-existent check\n\n*Note*: Overlaps with #895 Test 10.\n\n---\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"bias_quantile() errors on predictions that decrease with increasing quantile level\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: confirms that the existing hard error in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (metrics-quantile.R:495) is preserved after the fix — the assert_forecast warning should NOT replace this error\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-metrics-quantile.R`\n**Setup**:\n- `predicted <- c(1, 2, 4, 3)` — prediction at q=0.9 (3) is less than q=0.5 (4)\n- `quantiles <- c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.9)`\n- `observed <- 3`\n**Action**:\n- Call `bias_quantile(observed = 3, predicted, quantiles)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_error(bias_quantile(observed = 3, predicted, quantiles), \"Predictions must not be decreasing with increasing quantile level\")` — hard error preserved\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS both before and after the fix. It already exists at `test-metrics-quantile.R:852-861`. Including it here to document that the #412 plan explicitly says \"enforce it in `bias_quantile()` as it's needed there\" — which is already done.\n\n---\n\n### Test 5: test_that(\"bias_quantile() succeeds when quantile levels are unordered but predictions are monotonic after sorting\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: edge case — `bias_quantile_single_vector()` sorts by `quantile_level` before checking monotonicity; if predictions track quantile_level order correctly but are passed in scrambled order, the function should succeed\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-metrics-quantile.R`\n**Setup**:\n- `predicted <- c(5, 2, 8)` — out of order, but after sorting by quantile_level = c(0.5, 0.25, 0.75) they become c(2, 5, 8) which is monotonic\n- `quantiles <- c(0.5, 0.25, 0.75)` — unsorted quantile levels\n- `observed <- 4`\n**Action**:\n- Call `bias_quantile(observed = 4, predicted, quantiles)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_silent(bias_quantile(observed = 4, predicted, quantiles))` — no error, because after sorting by quantile_level the predictions are non-decreasing\n- Returns a numeric bias value\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS both before and after the fix. It verifies that the existing sort-then-check logic in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` works correctly for scrambled input order.\n\n---\n\n### Test 6: test_that(\"score() with non-monotonic predictions warns at validation and handles bias metric gracefully\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the end-to-end user experience described in #412 — a user with non-monotonic predictions should get an early warning at `as_forecast_quantile()` time, and `score()` should handle the `bias_quantile` failure gracefully (via `run_safely()` converting the error to a warning)\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R`\n**Setup**:\n- Create a data.table with 2 forecast units: one monotonic, one non-monotonic\n  ```\n  rbind(\n    data.table(model = \"good\", date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"), observed = 5,\n               quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), predicted = c(2, 5, 8)),\n    data.table(model = \"bad\", date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"), observed = 5,\n               quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), predicted = c(3, 7, 4))\n  )\n  ```\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile` (expecting a warning about non-monotonic predictions)\n**Action**:\n- Call `score(forecast_obj)` with default metrics (which includes `bias_quantile`)\n**Expected**:\n- `score()` should NOT abort entirely — `run_safely()` converts the `bias_quantile` error to a per-metric warning\n- The resulting scores object should contain WIS and other metrics for both models\n- The `bias_quantile` metric should either be `NA` for the non-monotonic forecast unit or produce a per-metric warning\n- The overall result should be a valid `scores` object\n**Fails now because**:\n- Currently, `as_forecast_quantile()` emits no warning about the non-monotonic data. The user only discovers the problem inside `score()` when `bias_quantile` errors per forecast unit, with warnings from `run_safely()`. After the fix, the user gets early feedback at `as_forecast_quantile()` time.\n\n---\n\n### Test 7: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() identifies the specific forecast units with monotonicity violations\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the helper function request from #412's discussion (\"write a helper function to check that\")\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (or new `test-get-non-monotonic-forecasts.R`)\n**Setup**:\n- Create 3 forecast units:\n  - model=\"A\", date=\"2020-01-01\": `predicted = c(2, 5, 8)` — monotonic (OK)\n  - model=\"B\", date=\"2020-01-01\": `predicted = c(3, 7, 4)` — non-monotonic (BAD)\n  - model=\"C\", date=\"2020-01-01\": `predicted = c(1, 1, 1)` — flat/constant (OK — non-decreasing)\n- All with `quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)`, `observed = 5`\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile` (suppressing the warning)\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(data)`\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a `data.table` containing only the rows for model=\"B\" (the non-monotonic forecast unit)\n- `nrow(result) == 3` (all quantile rows for the affected unit, so the user can inspect the full picture)\n- model=\"A\" and model=\"C\" are NOT in the result\n- Model C with flat/constant predictions is correctly treated as non-decreasing (passes `diff(predicted) >= 0` check)\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` does not exist yet; call will error with \"could not find function\"\n\n*Note*: Overlaps with #895 Tests 2-3, 12.

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature). If yes, run `usethis::use_release_issue()` and proceed with CRAN submission. If not, close the issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1064 | Pre-ranking for multivariate calibration assessment | | 2026-01-30 | feature | medium | large | no | No pre-ranking or multivariate calibration diagnostics exist in the codebase. The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns.

WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types.

No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant.

The issue concerns the one-to-one correspondence between quantile-format and interval-format metric functions. Currently: `interval_score()` is internal (not exported), called by `wis()` after `quantile_to_interval()` conversion. Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases.

The broad goal is better served by: (1) completing S3 extensibility infrastructure (#852, #983, #889, #888), (2) writing an interoperability vignette (#356), and (3) possibly adding 1-2 zero-dependency convenience converters if demand warrants. Too broad to be directly actionable as stated. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}
