Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error.

Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site.

WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs.

Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

No conversion functions for external packages (Stan, Odin, yardstick, hubverse) exist. The `as_forecast_*` S3 generic system provides extension points for external packages to write their own methods.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

Consensus reached on MVP: add a warning when `get_type(predicted) == \"integer\"`. Discussion also suggested possibly removing `log_score` from default metrics for sample forecasts. | None. All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

P-values can be\n#' computed in two ways: based on a nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test\n#' (internally using [wilcox.test()] with `paired = TRUE`) or based on a\n#' permutation test. The permutation test is based on the difference in mean\n#' scores between two models. The default null hypothesis is that the mean score\n#' difference is zero (see [permutation_test()]).\n#' Adjusted p-values are computed by calling [p.adjust()] on the raw p-values.\n#'\n#' The code for the pairwise comparisons is inspired by an implementation by\n#' Johannes Bracher.\n#' The implementation of the permutation test follows the function\n#' `permutationTest` from the `surveillance` package by Michael Höhle,\n#' Andrea Riebler and Michaela Paul.\n#'\n#' @param compare Character vector with a single colum name that defines the\n#'   elements for the pairwise comparison.

Update roxygen `@param` tags accordingly.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant. `test_type`, `one_sided`, and `n_permutations` are still passed via `...` through 3 levels (`get_pairwise_comparisons` -> `pairwise_comparison_one_group` -> `compare_forecasts`). Users must read internal `compare_forecasts` docs to discover options. PR #994 added `test_type = NULL` but didn't address the `...` pattern. #750 (split out p-values) was deferred.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-pairwise_comparison.R` (existing)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat with data.table fixtures; pre-computed `scores_quantile`, `scores_sample_continuous`, `scores_point` from `setup.R`; `suppressMessages()` used around some calls; `expect_no_condition()` / `expect_no_warning()` used for smoke tests; vdiffr for visual regression of plots.\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"get_pairwise_comparisons() accepts test_type as explicit argument\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core API issue — `test_type` is not a visible parameter of `get_pairwise_comparisons()`\n**Setup**:\n- Use pre-computed `scores_quantile` from `setup.R`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_pairwise_comparisons(scores_quantile, test_type = \"non_parametric\")` (explicit named arg)\n- Call `get_pairwise_comparisons(scores_quantile, test_type = \"permutation\")` (explicit named arg)\n- Call `get_pairwise_comparisons(scores_quantile, test_type = NULL)` (explicit named arg, skip p-values)\n**Expected**:\n- All three calls succeed without error\n- When `test_type = NULL`, the `pval` column should be all `NA`\n- When `test_type = \"non_parametric\"` or `\"permutation\"`, the `pval` column should contain numeric values (not NA)\n- `test_type` should appear in `formals(get_pairwise_comparisons)`, i.e., `\"test_type\" %in% names(formals(get_pairwise_comparisons))` is TRUE\n**Fails now because**:\n- `test_type` is not a formal parameter of `get_pairwise_comparisons()`. It only works via `...` passthrough to `compare_forecasts()`. After the fix, it will be an explicit parameter. The `formals()` check will fail against current code because `test_type` is not in the function's parameter list.\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"get_pairwise_comparisons() accepts one_sided as explicit argument\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: `one_sided` is not discoverable in `get_pairwise_comparisons()` API\n**Setup**:\n- Use pre-computed `scores_quantile` from `setup.R`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_pairwise_comparisons(scores_quantile, one_sided = TRUE, test_type = \"permutation\", n_permutations = 50)`\n- Call `get_pairwise_comparisons(scores_quantile, one_sided = FALSE, test_type = \"permutation\", n_permutations = 50)`\n**Expected**:\n- Both calls succeed without error\n- Both return data.tables with a `pval` column containing numeric values\n- `one_sided` should appear in `formals(get_pairwise_comparisons)`, i.e., `\"one_sided\" %in% names(formals(get_pairwise_comparisons))` is TRUE\n**Fails now because**:\n- `one_sided` is not a formal parameter of `get_pairwise_comparisons()`.

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature). If yes, run `usethis::use_release_issue()` and proceed with CRAN submission. If not, close the issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1064 | Pre-ranking for multivariate calibration assessment | | 2026-01-30 | feature | medium | large | no | No pre-ranking or multivariate calibration diagnostics exist in the codebase. The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al. (2008) as calibration diagnostics for multivariate forecasts, after resolving the API design choice with maintainers. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1057 | Revise README to remove news about the package rewrite | documentation | 2026-01-29 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Open, no assignee. The rewrite messaging and Google Drive paper links appear in 4 locations in README.Rmd. Mechanical edits are straightforward but replacement text requires editorial decisions about where to point users for documentation. | Loosely related to #810 (pkgdown for dev docs) and #759 (future of scoringutils.Rmd vignette). | Edit `README.Rmd` to remove/soften the \"major re-write\" paragraph and replace Google Drive paper links with pointers to package vignettes/docs, then re-render README.md. Confirm preferred documentation hierarchy with maintainers first. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1055 | Model confidence sets | feature request | 2026-01-19 | feature | medium | large | no | Design phase — methodology not yet agreed upon. 6 comments with active debate. Naive pairwise p-value approach acknowledged as incomplete. Three alternatives discussed: Hansen et al. MCS, novel extension for incomplete sets, Bayesian approach. No consensus reached. | Relates to #750 (p-value computation refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #37 (Diebold-Mariano test), #1022 (two-model pairwise). | Resolve design consensus on which MCS methodology to implement (Hansen et al. on complete sets, novel incomplete-set extension, or Bayesian), then implement `get_model_confidence_set()` building on existing pairwise comparison infrastructure. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1046 | multivariate scoring in scoring rules vignette | documentation | 2025-11-04 | documentation | low | small | partially | Open, agreed upon by maintainers. The scoring-rules vignette has zero mentions of multivariate scoring. A dedicated multivariate vignette already exists. Only a cross-reference and brief section are missing. | None. All underlying code and the dedicated multivariate vignette already exist. | Add a short section to `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd` describing the energy score for multivariate forecasts and cross-linking to the existing `scoring-multivariate-forecasts` vignette. No code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1044 | Remove the commented out vignette code. | | 2025-09-23 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Two HTML comment blocks remain: a WIP \"Details on the grouping\" section in `scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` (lines 88-102) and a ~50-line PIT/Calibration section in `scoring-rules.Rmd` (lines 444-493). Originated from PR #998 review comment. | None. | Delete the two HTML-commented-out code blocks from `vignettes/scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` and `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd`. Optionally confirm with maintainers whether the PIT/Calibration text should be preserved elsewhere. | N/A | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1043 | Update print method for multivariate forecasts to show `joint_across` | | 2025-09-21 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output. Update test snapshots. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1026 | as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile | enhancement | 2025-07-13 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples. Requires design decision on approximation method and potential new package dependency. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1022 | Let `get_pairwise_comparison()` run with two models? | | 2025-07-03 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette. The scoring-rules vignette mentions local/global in text only, with no visual. Code to regenerate is in the issue body. | Sibling issues: #929, #930, #933 (all repurpose manuscript illustrations). Consider batching. | Add the existing `score-locality.png` to `scoring-rules.Rmd` (or a new comparative vignette) with an explanatory paragraph on local vs. global scoring rules. Coordinate with #929/#930/#933 for a unified approach. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 933 | Use nice illustration of CRPS/DSS/Log score + the number of samples needed for scores to converge | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `score-convergence-outliers.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned (not referenced by any vignette). Issue #758 contains a detailed draft vignette stub (\"Choosing a scoring rule\") that already references this PNG with prose. Should be batched with siblings #929, #930, #934. | Sibling issues #929, #930, #934. Parent issue #758 (scoring rules explanation vignette). Related to #759 (vignette future). | Create a new \"Choosing a scoring rule\" vignette (per #758's stub) or integrate `score-convergence-outliers.png` into `scoring-rules.Rmd` with explanatory text on sample convergence and score properties. Best addressed as a batch with #929/#930/#934 under #758. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 930 | Use nice illustration of the effect of increasing the mean on increasing average scores | documentation | 2024-09-27 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `illustration-effect-scale.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned. A deleted stub vignette (`Choosing-a-score.Rmd`) once referenced it. Author expressed uncertainty (\"maybe we don't want it anymore\"). Should be batched with siblings #929, #933, #934. | Sibling issues #929, #933, #934. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #759 (vignette future). | Decide whether to integrate `illustration-effect-scale.png` into `scoring-rules.Rmd` or a new \"Choosing a score\" vignette, with text explaining how average scores scale with forecast target magnitude. If unwanted, close and delete orphaned PNG. Address with #929/#933/#934 as batch. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 929 | Use nice illustration of Sharpness and calibration | documentation | 2024-09-27 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. Unlike siblings (#930, #933, #934), the calibration/sharpness PNG does **not** exist in the repo — it was never generated. Code to create it is in the issue body. The `scoring-rules.Rmd` has a commented-out calibration section (lines ~449-492) where this illustration would naturally fit. | Sibling issues #930, #933, #934. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #759 (vignette future), #785 (vignette updates). | Generate `calibration-sharpness-illustration.png` from the code in the issue body, place in `vignettes/`, and integrate into `scoring-rules.Rmd` (or a new \"Choosing a score\" vignette). Coordinate with #930/#933/#934 batch. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 927 | Make all internal columns, in particular `forecast_id`, more robust by prefixing it with \"scoringutils_\" | good first issue, high-priority | 2024-09-26 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. Unprefixed internal columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) risk collision with user data columns. Codebase already mixes two conventions: `.scoringutils_*` (e.g., `.scoringutils_N`) and `scoringutils_Internal*`. ~3 source files, 1 globalVariables file, 1 snapshot to update for `forecast_id` alone. Not a breaking change — all affected columns are internal. | None blocking. Self-contained refactor. | Rename unprefixed internal temp columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) to `.scoringutils_` prefix, matching existing convention. Update `R/helper-quantile-interval-range.R`, `R/metrics-quantile.R`, `R/z-globalVariables.R`, and test snapshots. Also unify the two naming conventions (`.scoringutils_*` vs `scoringutils_Internal*`). | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 922 | remove `check_columns_present` | | 2024-09-25 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `check_columns_present` (and `test_columns_present`) are internal functions with 10 call sites across 9 files. All can be replaced by `checkmate::assert_subset`/`check_subset`/`test_subset` (already a dependency). One call site in `pairwise-comparisons.R:143` uses a custom error message and needs slightly different handling. No user-facing API impact. | Related to #839 (remove `test_columns_not_present`) — both modify `R/check-input-helpers.R`, should be batched. | Replace all 10 call sites of `check_columns_present` (and 1 of `test_columns_present`) with equivalent `checkmate` functions, then delete both functions and their tests. Consider batching with #839. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 909 | Compact version of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` | enhancement, good first issue, help wanted | 2024-09-13 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Already implemented. The `counts` parameter on `get_duplicate_forecasts()` provides exactly the compact output requested. Tests exist. Issue can be closed. | None | Close this issue — the `counts` argument already provides compact/aggregated duplicate output. No further code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 907 | coverage of function factory | enhancement | 2024-09-12 | enhancement | low | small | partially | Still relevant. No factory helper exists. Users must manually use `purrr::partial()` (documented in `score()` docs). Only `interval_coverage` benefits currently. Hard-coded 50% and 90% variants in `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()`. Discussion stalled after 5 comments with no consensus on approach. | Related to #451 (quantile/interval metric organization), #668 (coverage flexibility). | Add either a generic `expand_metric()` utility or a `coverage_ranges` argument to `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()` to programmatically generate multiple parameterized coverage metric variants. Needs design decision on approach given only one metric currently benefits. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 898 | Support for \"Mixture of Parameters\" scoring | feature request | 2024-09-06 | feature | low | large | partially | Still relevant but low urgency. No `forecast_distribution` class exists. Prerequisites #832 (metrics S3 rework) and #846 (ordinal class) are done. Original requester has deprioritized. Would require new class, input format design, dispatch to `scoringRules` parametric functions, and mixture handling. | #888 (S3 rework of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` — minor blocker for clean extensibility). Builds on completed #832, #846. | Implement a new `forecast_distribution` class for scoring forecasts expressed as parametric distributions or mixtures, dispatching to `scoringRules`' closed-form scoring functions. Deferred until active demand — keep on `scoringutils-2.x` milestone. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 895 | Check quantile prediction order helper function | enhancement | 2024-08-19 | enhancement | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. Monotonicity check only exists deep in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (metrics-quantile.R:495) as a hard error. No early warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. No user-facing diagnostic function. Issue #412 is the maintainer-created parent with an agreed plan (steps 1 and 3 not done). | Duplicate of / should be resolved together with #412. | Create a user-facing helper (e.g., `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`) to identify rows where predictions decrease with increasing quantile level, and add a warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. Resolves both #895 and #412. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 889 | Make `get_protected_columns()` S3 to avoid hard-coding things | high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_protected_columns()` is a plain function with a hard-coded superset of all column names for all forecast types. Not S3. Only 2 call sites (both in `forecast-unit.R`). The `intersect()` filter masks the problem but prevents extensibility for new forecast classes. No progress made. | Coordinate with #888 (same S3 pattern for `get_duplicate_forecasts()`). Unblocks #852 (new forecast class workflow). Largely resolves #740 (`get_forecast_unit` customization). | Convert `get_protected_columns()` into an S3 generic with per-class methods so each forecast type declares its own protected columns. Coordinate with #888 for consistent pattern. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 888 | Rework `get_duplicate_forecasts()` to S3 to avoid hard-coding columns and types | high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. Function hard-codes `c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\", \"predicted_label\")` in two places instead of dispatching on S3 class. No work done. Codebase has many S3 precedents now. | Coordinate with #889 (same pattern for `get_protected_columns()`). Partially blocks #898, #852. Related to #740. | Convert `get_duplicate_forecasts()` into an S3 generic with per-class methods where each method knows its own type-specific columns. Retain a `.data.frame`/`.default` method with current column-sniffing logic for backward compatibility. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 885 | Functions to export or make internal | refactor, high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Partially done. `validate_forecast()` already deleted (PR #921). Remaining: `as_forecast_generic()`, `as_scores()`, `apply_metrics()` still internal; `new_forecast()` ambiguously exported with `@keywords internal`. Design decision needed on which functions to export for custom forecast class authors. | Depends on #746 (closed). Blocks custom forecast class creation. Related to #852 (design workflow for new classes). | Decide final export list for custom forecast class API: export `as_forecast_generic()`, `as_scores()`, `apply_metrics()`, resolve ambiguous `new_forecast()` status, and update NAMESPACE. Needs maintainer decision on naming/prefixing. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 880 | Allow users to specify the quantile in `as_forecast_point.forecast_quantile()? | | 2024-07-30 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Function hard-codes `0.5` on two lines (107, 115) in `R/class-forecast-quantile.R`. Design decisions already resolved in PR #876 discussion: parameter name `quantile_level`, default `0.5`, passed via `...`. No work done since issue opened. | None. Self-contained enhancement. | Add a `quantile_level` parameter (default `0.5`) to `as_forecast_point.forecast_quantile()`, replacing the two hard-coded `0.5` references, then add tests and documentation. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 872 | Add a reference for CRPS decomposition approach. | | 2024-07-25 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `crps_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R` has only a `scoringRules` package reference, not one for the decomposition approach. `wis()` already properly cites Bracher et al. 2021. Minor decision needed on which paper(s) to cite: Bracher et al. 2021 and/or Arnold et al. 2023. | Related to #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor). Could be addressed in same PR. | Add `@references` entries to `crps_sample()` roxygen block citing paper(s) formalizing the overprediction/underprediction/dispersion decomposition (likely Bracher et al. 2021 and/or Arnold et al. 2023). | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 870 | Refactor CRPS and WIS decomposition | refactor | 2024-07-22 | refactor | low | medium | partially | Partially addressed. PR #985 (Feb 2025) simplified `crps_sample()` decomposition internally, but the structural duplication remains: `crps_sample()`, `wis()`, and `interval_score()` each independently implement `separate_results` branching, and 6 wrapper functions (3 sample + 3 quantile) repeat identical extraction patterns. | Related to #872 (CRPS decomposition reference). Filed during PR #854 review. On `scoringutils-2.x` milestone. | Extract the decomposition logic (`separate_results` branching and wrapper function boilerplate) into a shared internal helper or factory pattern so `crps_sample()`, `wis()`, and `interval_score()` delegate to the same mechanism instead of each implementing it independently. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 852 | Design workflow for creating new forecast classes | enhancement | 2024-07-10 | enhancement | high | large | no | Still relevant.

Replaced by `get_pit_histogram()` (S3 generic with methods for `forecast_sample` and `forecast_quantile`) and `pit_histogram_sample()` for low-level computation. Plotting is now via standard ggplot2 calls. The dual-purpose if/else concern no longer exists. | None. | Close as completed.

PR #994 added `test_type = NULL` to skip p-value computation, resolving the main pain point (spurious warnings from `add_relative_skill()`). The broader architectural question of separating p-value from score ratio computation remains open but contributor consensus was option 1 (do nothing). | #769 (explicit test_type argument) should be considered together. #1022 (two-model case) tangentially related. | Consider closing as won't-fix or converting to long-term design discussion. The practical problem was solved by PR #994.

The issue concerns the one-to-one correspondence between quantile-format and interval-format metric functions. Currently: `interval_score()` is internal (not exported), called by `wis()` after `quantile_to_interval()` conversion. Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy.
