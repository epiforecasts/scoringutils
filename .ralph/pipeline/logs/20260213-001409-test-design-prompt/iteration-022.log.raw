Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    33→| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    34→| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    42→| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

No conversion functions for external packages (Stan, Odin, yardstick, hubverse) exist. The `as_forecast_*` S3 generic system provides extension points for external packages to write their own methods.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite.

Metrics with non-standard I/O (many-to-one like AUC, many-to-many like PIT) cannot fit into `score()`. The PIT case is solved outside `score()` via `get_pit_histogram()`. Zero comments, no design consensus.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

Consensus reached on MVP: add a warning when `get_type(predicted) == \"integer\"`. Discussion also suggested possibly removing `log_score` from default metrics for sample forecasts. | None. All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

Update downstream column handling, summarisation, and tests.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant and unimplemented. `get_coverage()` always computes all 4 coverage metrics with no user control. The issue body contains a near-complete code proposal (with a minor bug to fix). The function structure already cleanly separates interval and quantile computation paths. On `scoringutils-2.x` milestone.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-get-coverage.R` (existing)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat with data.table operations; `example_quantile` used as primary test data; existing tests check column names via `sort(colnames(cov))`, check row counts, check output class; `get_forecast_unit()` and `get_range_from_quantile()` used as helpers; `expect_no_condition()` used to verify no warnings/errors; `na.omit()` applied to example data before use.\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"get_coverage() with type = 'interval' returns only interval coverage columns\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core missing feature — inability to request only interval coverage\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` as input (already a `forecast_quantile` object)\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_coverage(example_quantile, by = \"model\", type = \"interval\")`\n**Expected**:\n- Result is a `data.table` (class `c(\"data.table\", \"data.frame\")`)\n- Result contains columns `\"interval_coverage\"` and `\"interval_coverage_deviation\"`\n- Result does NOT contain columns `\"quantile_coverage\"` or `\"quantile_coverage_deviation\"`\n- Result contains `\"interval_range\"` column (needed for interval coverage grouping)\n- Result contains `\"model\"` column (from `by`)\n- `interval_coverage` values are all numeric and between 0 and 1\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_coverage()` does not accept a `type` argument; calling with `type = \"interval\"` will produce an \"unused argument\" error\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"get_coverage() with type = 'quantile' returns only quantile coverage columns\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core missing feature — inability to request only quantile coverage\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` as input\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_coverage(example_quantile, by = \"model\", type = \"quantile\")`\n**Expected**:\n- Result is a `data.table`\n- Result contains columns `\"quantile_coverage\"` and `\"quantile_coverage_deviation\"`\n- Result does NOT contain columns `\"interval_coverage\"` or `\"interval_coverage_deviation\"`\n- Result contains `\"quantile_level\"` column (needed for quantile coverage grouping)\n- Result contains `\"model\"` column (from `by`)\n- `quantile_coverage` values are all numeric and between 0 and 1\n- Result should NOT contain `\"interval_range\"` column (not relevant when only quantile coverage requested)\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_coverage()` does not accept a `type` argument; calling with `type = \"quantile\"` will produce an \"unused argument\" error\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"get_coverage() with type = c('quantile', 'interval') returns both (default behavior)\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: verifies the default value preserves backward compatibility\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` as input\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_coverage(example_quantile, by = \"model\")` (no `type` argument — uses default)\n- Also call `get_coverage(example_quantile, by = \"model\", type = c(\"quantile\", \"interval\"))` (explicit default)\n**Expected**:\n- Both calls produce identical results (use `expect_identical()`)\n- Result contains all 4 coverage columns: `\"interval_coverage\"`, `\"interval_coverage_deviation\"`, `\"quantile_coverage\"`, `\"quantile_coverage_deviation\"`\n- Result contains both `\"quantile_level\"` and `\"interval_range\"` columns\n- This matches the current behavior of `get_coverage()` exactly — backward compatible\n**Fails now because**:\n- The explicit `type = c(\"quantile\", \"interval\")` call will produce an \"unused argument\" error. The implicit (no `type`) call should work and produce the same results as current code.\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"get_coverage() with type = 'interval' produces correct coverage values\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: validates numerical correctness of interval-only coverage\n**Setup**:\n- Create a small, hand-crafted `forecast_quantile` object with known coverage properties.

Update downstream column handling, summarisation, and tests.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant and unimplemented. `get_coverage()` always computes all 4 coverage metrics with no user control. The issue body contains a near-complete code proposal (with a minor bug to fix). The function structure already cleanly separates interval and quantile computation paths. On `scoringutils-2.x` milestone.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-get-coverage.R` (existing)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat with data.table operations; `example_quantile` used as primary test data; existing tests check column names via `sort(colnames(cov))`, check row counts, check output class; `get_forecast_unit()` and `get_range_from_quantile()` used as helpers; `expect_no_condition()` used to verify no warnings/errors; `na.omit()` applied to example data before use.\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"get_coverage() with type = 'interval' returns only interval coverage columns\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core missing feature — inability to request only interval coverage\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` as input (already a `forecast_quantile` object)\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_coverage(example_quantile, by = \"model\", type = \"interval\")`\n**Expected**:\n- Result is a `data.table` (class `c(\"data.table\", \"data.frame\")`)\n- Result contains columns `\"interval_coverage\"` and `\"interval_coverage_deviation\"`\n- Result does NOT contain columns `\"quantile_coverage\"` or `\"quantile_coverage_deviation\"`\n- Result contains `\"interval_range\"` column (needed for interval coverage grouping)\n- Result contains `\"model\"` column (from `by`)\n- `interval_coverage` values are all numeric and between 0 and 1\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_coverage()` does not accept a `type` argument; calling with `type = \"interval\"` will produce an \"unused argument\" error\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"get_coverage() with type = 'quantile' returns only quantile coverage columns\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core missing feature — inability to request only quantile coverage\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` as input\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_coverage(example_quantile, by = \"model\", type = \"quantile\")`\n**Expected**:\n- Result is a `data.table`\n- Result contains columns `\"quantile_coverage\"` and `\"quantile_coverage_deviation\"`\n- Result does NOT contain columns `\"interval_coverage\"` or `\"interval_coverage_deviation\"`\n- Result contains `\"quantile_level\"` column (needed for quantile coverage grouping)\n- Result contains `\"model\"` column (from `by`)\n- `quantile_coverage` values are all numeric and between 0 and 1\n- Result should NOT contain `\"interval_range\"` column (not relevant when only quantile coverage requested)\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_coverage()` does not accept a `type` argument; calling with `type = \"quantile\"` will produce an \"unused argument\" error\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"get_coverage() with type = c('quantile', 'interval') returns both (default behavior)\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: verifies the default value preserves backward compatibility\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` as input\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_coverage(example_quantile, by = \"model\")` (no `type` argument — uses default)\n- Also call `get_coverage(example_quantile, by = \"model\", type = c(\"quantile\", \"interval\"))` (explicit default)\n**Expected**:\n- Both calls produce identical results (use `expect_identical()`)\n- Result contains all 4 coverage columns: `\"interval_coverage\"`, `\"interval_coverage_deviation\"`, `\"quantile_coverage\"`, `\"quantile_coverage_deviation\"`\n- Result contains both `\"quantile_level\"` and `\"interval_range\"` columns\n- This matches the current behavior of `get_coverage()` exactly — backward compatible\n**Fails now because**:\n- The explicit `type = c(\"quantile\", \"interval\")` call will produce an \"unused argument\" error.

Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types.

The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name.

All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`).

All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile.

Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns.

WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Unprefixed internal columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) risk collision with user data columns. Codebase already mixes two conventions: `.scoringutils_*` (e.g., `.scoringutils_N`) and `scoringutils_Internal*`. ~3 source files, 1 globalVariables file, 1 snapshot to update for `forecast_id` alone. Not a breaking change — all affected columns are internal. | None blocking. Self-contained refactor. | Rename unprefixed internal temp columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) to `.scoringutils_` prefix, matching existing convention. Update `R/helper-quantile-interval-range.R`, `R/metrics-quantile.R`, `R/z-globalVariables.R`, and test snapshots.

No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy.

A commented-out test skeleton exists in `test-score.R` (lines 51-62). `apply_metrics()` silently overwrites any existing column whose name matches a metric name via `forecast[, (metric_name) := result]`. No pre-scoring clash detection exists. | Tangentially related to #927 (prefix internal columns). Could coordinate with #811 (batch warnings). No blockers. | Add a check after `validate_metrics(metrics)` in each `score.forecast_*` method comparing `names(metrics)` against `colnames(forecast)` and emitting `cli_warn()` on overlap. Uncomment and update the existing test skeleton in `test-score.R`. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 363 | Discussion: design interface for external functions with different input/output formats | help wanted, question | 2023-10-26 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No wrapper/adapter functions exist. Users must manually wrap external metrics with non-standard signatures (e.g., reversed arg order, numeric 0/1 instead of factor observed). Two small wrapper proposals in the issue body (`wrap_binary_numeric`, `wrap_switch_order`) were never implemented. The `purrr::partial()` mechanism alone cannot solve argument reordering or type conversion. Zero comments, no design consensus. 2+ years old. | Related to #362 (non-standard I/O formats), #522 (test user-provided scoring functions), #385 (data transformation), #789 (customization docs). No blockers. | Implement 2-3 small exported adapter functions (e.g., `metric_adapt_binary_numeric()` to convert factor to 0/1, `metric_adapt_swap_args()` to reverse observed/predicted order). Document usage in `score()`'s \"Customising metrics\" section. Resolve naming convention with maintainers first. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 362 | Discussion: How to handle scores with input / output formats not currently covered | question | 2023-10-26 | discussion | low | large | no | Still relevant. `apply_metrics()` requires each metric to return a numeric vector of length n (one per forecast unit). Metrics with non-standard I/O (many-to-one like AUC, many-to-many like PIT) cannot fit into `score()`. The PIT case is solved outside `score()` via `get_pit_histogram()`. Zero comments, no design consensus. The multivariate sample class introduced a partial precedent (multiple rows collapse into groups) but by restructuring data before `apply_metrics()`, not by changing it. 2+ years old. | Related to #455 (data frame returns — recommended for closure), #363 (wrapper functions), #338 (cross-type metrics), #941 (rethink `score()` S3), #852 (custom class workflow). | Long-term design question with no clear path forward. The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established. Consider closing as won't-fix or consolidating with #455, #363, #338 into a single milestone-level tracking issue. Any solution requires fundamental changes to `apply_metrics()`. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 360 | Create a wrapper around log score to warn about its use for integer-valued forecasts | implementation-ready | 2023-10-26 | enhancement | medium | small | yes | Still relevant and unaddressed. `logs_sample()` is a thin wrapper with no integer detection or warning. `get_type()` already exists and is used by `bias_sample()` and `pit_histogram_sample()` for the same purpose. Consensus reached on MVP: add a warning when `get_type(predicted) == \"integer\"`. Discussion also suggested possibly removing `log_score` from default metrics for sample forecasts. | None. All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued. Optionally move `log_score` out of the default metric list in `get_metrics.forecast_sample()`. Add targeted tests. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 356 | Documentation: Create a vignette for interactions with other packages | documentation | 2023-10-26 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. No interoperability vignette exists. Deprecated-visualisations vignette mentions hubVis. Hubverse integration moved to external `hubEvals` package (#605, closed). No conversion functions for external packages exist in scoringutils. `as_forecast_*` S3 generics provide extension points for external packages. ~2.5 years old with no progress. | Related to #385 (data transformation for other packages), #852 (custom forecast class workflow), #983 (`.data.frame` methods). | Create a vignette documenting how to use scoringutils with common external packages (hubverse via hubEvals, Stan output, yardstick). Focus on showing the `as_forecast_*()` S3 extension mechanism and practical conversion patterns.

The deleted `scoringutils.Rmd` vignette (PR #836) covered 3 of 4 bullet points; replacement was never written. README \"Quick start\" section partially addresses input formats and workflow. The \"create your own class\" bullet is blocked by prerequisite S3 refactors (#889, #888, #885). Package currently has no introductory or architecture vignette. | Tightly coupled with #546 (simplify getting started) and #759 (replace deleted vignette). \"Create your own class\" aspect depends on #852, blocked by #889, #888, #885. | Consider consolidating with #546 and #759 into a single effort to write a new introductory vignette covering input formats, the `as_forecast_*()` / `score()` workflow, and forecast object anatomy. Defer \"create your own class\" section until S3 extensibility refactors are complete. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 338 | Discussion: Define implementation for metrics which work for different forecast types | help wanted, question, Breaking change | 2023-10-22 | discussion | low | medium | no | Partially addressed by #832 (`get_metrics()` now S3). The remaining question is whether individual metric functions (e.g., `bias_sample`/`bias_quantile`) should also become S3 generics for standalone use. Practical need is low since `score()` already dispatches correctly via `get_metrics.<class>`. 6 conceptual metrics span 2+ forecast types with type-suffixed names. | #832 (done). Related to #455 (vector returns), #941 (rethink `score()` S3). No blockers. | Consider downgrading from \"Breaking change\" since S3 wrappers could be additive. If pursued, create `bias()`, `overprediction()`, `underprediction()`, `dispersion()`, `ae_median()`, `logs()` as S3 generics dispatching on forecast class, keeping suffixed functions as implementations. Defer to future major release. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 329 | Add additional documentation for `crps_sample()`, `logs_sample()` and `dss_sample()` | package improvement | 2023-09-15 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. Formulas exist in the vignette (`scoring-rules.Rmd`) but have not been ported to the roxygen docs for these three functions. Other functions in the same file (e.g., `bias_sample`, `pit_histogram_sample`) already have formula-rich roxygen documentation via `\\deqn{}`, providing a clear template. `dss_sample()` is worst — almost no description beyond \"wrapper.\" | None. Standalone documentation task. | Add `\\deqn{}` mathematical formulas and expanded descriptions to roxygen docs of `crps_sample()`, `logs_sample()`, and `dss_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R`. Adapt formulas from the existing vignette content. `dss_sample()` needs the most work. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 289 | Add support for comparing two distributions | | 2023-07-12 | feature | low | large | no | Still relevant. Zero implementation exists. The entire package architecture assumes scoring against scalar observations. No distribution comparison functions in codebase or in `scoringRules` dependency. Requires fundamental design decisions: new forecast class, new metric functions, and integration approach. 2.5+ years old with zero comments. Filed as an aspirational idea. | Related to #852 (custom forecast class workflow), #889/#888 (S3 extensibility). No issues depend on this. | Design and implement a new forecast class for distribution-to-distribution comparison with associated metrics (energy distance, KL divergence, Wasserstein distance).

No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy.
