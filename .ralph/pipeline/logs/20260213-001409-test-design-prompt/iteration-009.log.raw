Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    33→| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    34→| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    42→| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

I.e. this is fine: \r\n0.4 - 8\r\n0.2 - 4\r\n0.8 - 9\r\n0.6 - 8.5\r\n(there is this line: \r\n```\r\norder <- order(quantile_level)\r\npredicted <- predicted[order]\r\n```\r\n)\r\n\r\nBack then we decided to not enforce increasing quantiles generally, and just do it here. \r\n\r\nWe could (and probably should?) enforce this everywhere. But you can compute the other metrics without that. \r\n\r\nHow exactly where you thinking about the helper function?\r\n\r\nNote: I'd give it like a 30% chance that I misunderstood your intent or misrepresented what's currently happening.

If your quantile levels and quantiles look like this: \r\n0.2 - 4\r\n0.4 - 8\r\n0.6 - 7\r\n0.8 - 9\r\n\r\nthen it's unclear how to compute bias. Note that it doesn't require your quantile levels to be ordered as long as the corresponding quantiles are increasing. I.e. this is fine: \r\n0.4 - 8\r\n0.2 - 4\r\n0.8 - 9\r\n0.6 - 8.5\r\n(there is this line: \r\n```\r\norder <- order(quantile_level)\r\npredicted <- predicted[order]\r\n```\r\n)\r\n\r\nBack then we decided to not enforce increasing quantiles generally, and just do it here. \r\n\r\nWe could (and probably should?) enforce this everywhere. But you can compute the other metrics without that. \r\n\r\nHow exactly where you thinking about the helper function?\r\n\r\nNote: I'd give it like a 30% chance that I misunderstood your intent or misrepresented what's currently happening.

No hard blockers. @jbracher is already a scoringutils contributor. | Implement three new diagnostic tools from Bracher et al.: (1) add consistency bands and confidence intervals to existing coverage plots, (2) create `murphy_diagram()` function and plot, (3) create CORP reliability diagram function. Consider addressing #49 simultaneously. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n   126→| 267 | How to score literature/other resources | documentation, help wanted | 2023-02-13 | documentation | low | small | no | Still relevant. Function-level `@references` tags exist across 8 R files, and the scoring-rules vignette has a .bib with 7 papers. However, the agreed-upon deliverable — a standalone, discoverable vignette summarizing scoring methodology and linking to key literature — has not been created. Two vignettes referenced in the README (\"metric-details\", \"scoring-forecasts-directly\") do not exist on disk. ~3 years old. | None blocking. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #789 (customization docs), #666 (update paper). | Create a short standalone vignette summarizing scoring methodology and consolidating all referenced literature into one discoverable place. Link to the full paper and relevant external resources. Also fix the broken vignette links in the README.

SD and IQR (specifically requested) are not implemented. Both are trivial to add following the `mad_sample()` pattern (data-independent, apply function row-wise over predicted matrix). `dispersion_sample()` (CRPS component) also measures spread but is observation-dependent. `scoringRules` provides no additional sharpness measures. | None. Self-contained addition following existing `mad_sample()` pattern. | Implement `sd_sample()` and `iqr_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R` following the `mad_sample()` pattern. Add both to the default metric list in `get_metrics.forecast_sample()`. Add tests, documentation, and NAMESPACE exports. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n   128→| 49 | Improve calibration plotting | enhancement, feature request | 2020-07-25 | feature | low | medium | no | Partially addressed. PIT histograms exist via `get_pit_histogram()` (covering item 1 approximately). Items 2 (ACF of PIT values) and 3 (marginal calibration plot) are completely unimplemented. True Talagrand/verification rank histogram also not implemented as a distinct tool. Maintainer said \"no active plan, but nice to have.\" 5+ years old. | Thematically overlaps with #286 (advanced calibration diagnostics). No hard blockers. | Three remaining items: (1) implement verification rank histogram for ensemble/sample forecasts, (2) implement ACF computation/plot for PIT values, (3) implement marginal calibration plot. Consider consolidating with #286 into a single calibration diagnostics tracking issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n   129→| 37 | Add Diebold Mariano test | enhancement, good first issue, help wanted, feature request | 2020-06-20 | feature | low | small | partially | Still relevant. No DM test implementation exists. `compare_forecasts()` in `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` already has a clean `test_type` dispatch pattern (Wilcoxon and permutation). The DM test's main value-add is proper handling of autocorrelated score differences common in time-series forecasting. Open since 2020 with maintainer agreement but explicitly deferred. | Dependency of #1055 (model confidence sets). Related to #750 (p-value refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #1022 (two-model case). | Add `\"dm\"` as a new `test_type` option in `compare_forecasts()`. Self-implement the DM test statistic (preferred over adding `forecast` dependency) with Newey-West HAC variance estimator. Add tests and documentation.

CURRENT MONOTONICITY CHECK IN `bias_quantile`\n\n**Location:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/metrics-quantile.R`, lines 493-504\n\n**Exact Code:**\n```r\norder <- order(quantile_level)\npredicted <- predicted[order]\nif (!all(diff(predicted) >= 0)) {\n  #nolint start: keyword_quote_linter\n  cli_abort(\n    c(\n      \"!\" = \"Predictions must not be decreasing with increasing\n      quantile level.\"\n    )\n  )\n  #nolint end\n}\n```\n\n**Key Context:**\n- This check happens in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (internal function, lines 474-527)\n- It's a **hard error** using `cli_abort()`, not a warning\n- Occurs AFTER reordering predictions by quantile level to ensure proper alignment\n- Happens AFTER handling NA values (lines 480-491)\n- The check uses `diff(predicted) >= 0` to verify monotonic non-decreasing predictions\n\n**Full `bias_quantile_single_vector` Function Structure:**\n```r\nbias_quantile_single_vector <- function(observed, predicted,\n                                        quantile_level, na.rm) {\n  assert_number(observed)\n  \n  # Handle NAs\n  predicted_has_NAs <- anyNA(predicted)\n  quantile_has_NAs <- anyNA(quantile_level)\n  \n  if (any(predicted_has_NAs, quantile_has_NAs)) {\n    if (!na.rm) {\n      return(NA_real_)\n    }\n    quantile_level <- quantile_level[!is.na(predicted)]\n    predicted <- predicted[!is.na(predicted)]\n    predicted <- predicted[!is.na(quantile_level)]\n    quantile_level <- quantile_level[!is.na(quantile_level)]\n  }\n  \n  # ORDER AND CHECK MONOTONICITY\n  order <- order(quantile_level)\n  predicted <- predicted[order]\n  if (!all(diff(predicted) >= 0)) {\n    cli_abort(c(\"!\" = \"Predictions must not be decreasing with increasing quantile level.\"))\n  }\n  \n  # Continue with bias calculation...\n  median_prediction <- interpolate_median(predicted, quantile_level)\n  # ... rest of bias calculation logic\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile` - FULL METHOD\n\n**Location:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast-quantile.R`, lines 81-89\n\n**Exact Code:**\n```r\n#' @export\n#' @rdname assert_forecast\n#' @keywords validate-forecast-object\nassert_forecast.forecast_quantile <- function(\n  forecast, forecast_type = NULL, verbose = TRUE, ...\n) {\n  assert(check_columns_present(forecast, \"quantile_level\"))\n  forecast <- assert_forecast_generic(forecast, verbose)\n  assert_forecast_type(forecast, actual = \"quantile\", desired = forecast_type)\n  assert_numeric(forecast$quantile_level, lower = 0, upper = 1)\n  return(invisible(NULL))\n}\n```\n\n**What It Currently Checks:**\n1. ✅ Presence of `quantile_level` column\n2. ✅ Generic checks via `assert_forecast_generic()` (duplicates, NA count info, column names)\n3. ✅ Forecast type matches expected type\n4. ✅ `quantile_level` values are numeric and in [0, 1] range\n\n**What It Does NOT Check:**\n- ❌ Monotonicity: predictions don't decrease with increasing quantile level\n- ❌ No early warning before scoring\n- ❌ No user-facing diagnostic function\n\n**Connection to Generic Checks (`assert_forecast_generic`):**\nThe generic validation (lines 112-159 of `R/class-forecast.R`) checks:\n- Data is a data.table with min 1 row\n- Columns `observed` and `predicted` present\n- Either `quantile_level` OR `sample_id` present (but not both)\n- No duplicate forecasts\n- NA row handling with vague message: \"Some rows containing NA values may be removed. This is fine if not unexpected.\" (lines 148-152)\n\n---\n\n### 3. TEST PATTERNS - QUANTILE FORECAST TESTS\n\n#### `test-class-forecast-quantile.R` Structure:\n\n**Core Tests (lines 5-67):**\n- Basic conversion: `as_forecast_quantile()` works with various input formats\n- Error handling: missing columns, wrong types, duplicates\n- Rounding issues: handles floating-point rounding in quantile_level\n- Data.frame vs data.table compatibility\n- Conversion from sample forecasts: `as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample()`\n\n**Example Pattern (lines 56-67):**\n```r\ntest_that(\"as_forecast_quantile() function throws an error with duplicate forecasts\", {\n  example <- rbind(\n    example_quantile,\n    example_quantile[1000:1010]\n  )\n\n  expect_error(\n    suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(as_forecast_quantile(example))),\n    \"Assertion on 'data' failed: There are instances with more than one forecast for the same target...\", \n    fixed = TRUE\n  )\n})\n```\n\n#### `test-metrics-quantile.R` - Bias Tests (lines 709-903):\n\n**Test Patterns:**\n```r\n# Lines 837-850: Quantile ordering constraint\ntest_that(\"bias_quantile(): quantiles must be increasing\", {\n  predicted <- 1:4\n  quantiles <- c(0.8, 0.3, 0.5, 0.9)  # BAD: not ordered\n  \n  expect_error(\n    bias_quantile(observed = 3, predicted, quantiles),\n    \"Predictions must not be decreasing with increasing quantile level\"\n  )\n})\n\n# Lines 852-861: Prediction monotonicity constraint\ntest_that(\"bias_quantile(): predictions must be increasing\", {\n  predicted <- c(1, 2, 4, 3)  # BAD: not monotonic\n  quantiles <- c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.9)\n  \n  expect_error(\n    bias_quantile(observed = 3, predicted, quantiles),\n    \"Predictions must not be decreasing with increasing quantile level\"\n  )\n})\n\n# Lines 863-876: Quantile level uniqueness\ntest_that(\"bias_quantile(): quantile levels must be unique\", {\n  predicted <- 1:4\n  quantiles <- c(0.3, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8)  # BAD: duplicates\n  \n  expect_error(\n    bias_quantile(observed = 3, predicted, quantiles),\n    \"Assertion on 'quantile_level' failed: Contains duplicated values, position 2.\"\n  )\n})\n```\n\n**Key Test Conventions:**\n- Use both `expect_error()` and `expect_silent()` for passing cases\n- Suppress messages/warnings in conversion calls: `suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(...))`\n- Test both edge cases (NA handling, matrix input) and error conditions\n- Use `expect_no_condition()` for validation that should pass without output\n\n---\n\n### 4. HELPER PATTERN - `get_duplicate_forecasts()`\n\n**Location:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/get-duplicate-forecasts.R`, lines 19-48\n\n**Full Function:**\n```r\nget_duplicate_forecasts <- function(\n  data,\n  forecast_unit = NULL,\n  counts = FALSE\n) {\n  assert_data_frame(data)\n  data <- ensure_data.table(data)\n\n  if (!is.null(forecast_unit)) {\n    data <- set_forecast_unit(data, forecast_unit)\n  }\n  forecast_unit <- get_forecast_unit(data)\n  available_type <- c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\", \"predicted_label\") %in% colnames(data)\n  type <- c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\", \"predicted_label\")[available_type]\n  data <- as.data.table(data)\n  data[, scoringutils_InternalDuplicateCheck := .N, by = c(forecast_unit, type)]\n  out <- data[scoringutils_InternalDuplicateCheck > 1]\n\n  col <- colnames(data)[\n    colnames(data) %in% c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\", \"predicted_label\")\n  ]\n  setorderv(out, cols = c(forecast_unit, col, \"predicted\"))\n  out[, scoringutils_InternalDuplicateCheck := NULL]\n\n  if (counts) {\n    out <- out[, .(n_duplicates = .N), by = c(get_forecast_unit(out))]\n  }\n\n  return(out[])\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern for `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` to follow:**\n1. Accept `data` (forecast object)\n2. Accept optional `forecast_unit` parameter\n3. Accept optional `counts` parameter (for aggregated output)\n4. Use `get_forecast_unit()` to identify grouping columns\n5. Identify type-specific column (`quantile_level` for quantiles)\n6. Create internal temporary column with computation result\n7. Filter to rows meeting the condition\n8. Clean up and optionally aggregate by forecast unit\n9. Return data.table\n\n**Test Structure (lines 4-21):**\n```r\ntest_that(\"get_duplicate_forecasts() works as expected for quantile\", {\n  expect_no_condition(get_duplicate_forecasts(\n    example_quantile,\n    forecast_unit = c(\"location\", \"target_end_date\", \"target_type\", ...)\n  ))\n\n  expect_identical(nrow(get_duplicate_forecasts(example_quantile)), 0L)\n  expect_identical(\n    nrow(get_duplicate_forecasts(rbind(example_quantile, example_quantile[1000:1010]))),\n    22L\n  )\n})\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5.

WARNING PATTERN IN `forecast.R` (Generic NA handling)\n\n**Location:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast.R`, lines 136-156\n\n**Exact Code:**\n```r\n# check whether there are any NA values\nif (anyNA(data)) {\n  if (nrow(na.omit(data)) == 0) {\n    #nolint start: keyword_quote_linter\n    cli_abort(\n      c(\n        \"!\" = \"After removing rows with NA values in the data, no forecasts\n        are left.\"\n      )\n    )\n  }\n  if (verbose) {\n    cli_inform(\n      c(\n        \"i\" = \"Some rows containing NA values may be removed.\n        This is fine if not unexpected.\"\n      )\n    )\n  }\n  #nolint end\n}\n```\n\n**Problem Identified:**\n- The warning at lines 148-152 is **vague** - it doesn't tell users HOW MANY rows with NA will be removed\n- As noted in the ISSUE_TRIAGE.md (issue #537): \"The message in `assert_forecast_generic()` still says the generic 'Some rows containing NA values may be removed' without a row count.\"\n- Issue #895 is related and suggests improving similar messaging for monotonicity issues\n\n---\n\n### 7.

Create a user-facing helper function (e.g., `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`)\n2. Identify rows where predictions decrease with increasing quantile level\n3. Add a warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`\n\n**Action Summary (from triage):**\n> \"Create a user-facing helper (e.g., `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`) to identify rows where predictions decrease with increasing quantile level, and add a warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`.

Error Detection Pattern (used in bias_quantile tests):**\n```r\ntest_that(\"function(): constraint must hold\", {\n  bad_data <- <condition_that_violates_constraint>\n  expect_error(\n    function_call(bad_data),\n    \"Error message text\"\n  )\n  \n  good_data <- <data_meeting_constraint>\n  expect_silent(function_call(good_data))\n})\n```\n\n**2. Helper Function Pattern (for `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`):**\n- Input: forecast object (or raw data)\n- Optional: `forecast_unit` parameter for explicit specification\n- Optional: `counts` parameter for aggregated vs. detailed output\n- Output: data.table with non-monotonic rows OR summary table\n- Ordering: by forecast_unit and quantile columns\n- Cleanup: no temporary internal columns in output\n\n**3. Assertion Pattern (for `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` enhancement):**\n- Check should be non-fatal (warning, not error)\n- Only emit warning if non-monotonic rows detected\n- Message should be clear about what's wrong and how to diagnose\n- Follow the `cli_warn()` pattern with proper formatting\n\n**4. Integration Point:**\n- `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` currently only calls 4 assertions (line 84-87)\n- New check would be added as a 5th assertion\n- Should reuse the new `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` helper\n- Warning should suggest using `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` for diagnosis\n\n---\n\n### SUPPORTING CODE REFERENCES\n\n**Protected Columns Definition (for understanding forecast unit detection):**\n- Located: `R/forecast-unit.R`, lines 57-63\n- `get_forecast_unit()` extracts all columns except protected ones and metrics\n\n**Supported Forecast Unit Columns for Quantile:**\n```r\n# From test-class-forecast-quantile.R lines 23-31\nforecast_unit = c(\"model\", \"target_type\", \"target_end_date\", \n                  \"horizon\", \"location\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### SUMMARY FOR TEST SPECIFICATION WRITING\n\nYou now have:\n1. **Exact monotonicity check code** (lines 493-504 of metrics-quantile.R)\n2. **Current assert_forecast method** that needs enhancement (lines 81-89 of class-forecast-quantile.R)\n3. **Established helper function pattern** (get_duplicate_forecasts as template)\n4. **Real example data structure** (example_quantile with 10 columns)\n5. **Test conventions** used throughout the suite\n6. **Related issues** (#412, #537, #731) providing context on vague warning patterns\n7. **The agreed plan** from maintainers for implementation\n\nThe key insight is that this is a **three-part implementation**:\n- Part A: User-facing diagnostic function `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`\n- Part B: Warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`\n- Part C: Clear messaging patterns learned from NA warning issues"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: aba7a33 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 85991\ntool_uses: 38\nduration_ms: 96723</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"85af7904-8b76-495a-a761-ec1bec0c63a6","uuid":"b30c05e4-ffa7-44d1-a65c-00508dd8735b","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the test landscape and source code for issue #895 (quantile prediction order checking) in the scoringutils R package at /Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline.\n\nPlease investigate the following and report back with detailed findings:\n\n1. **Current monotonicity check in bias_quantile**: Read the relevant section of `R/metrics-quantile.R` around line 495 where the monotonicity check exists.

CURRENT MONOTONICITY CHECK IN `bias_quantile`\n\n**Location:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/metrics-quantile.R`, lines 493-504\n\n**Exact Code:**\n```r\norder <- order(quantile_level)\npredicted <- predicted[order]\nif (!all(diff(predicted) >= 0)) {\n  #nolint start: keyword_quote_linter\n  cli_abort(\n    c(\n      \"!\" = \"Predictions must not be decreasing with increasing\n      quantile level.\"\n    )\n  )\n  #nolint end\n}\n```\n\n**Key Context:**\n- This check happens in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (internal function, lines 474-527)\n- It's a **hard error** using `cli_abort()`, not a warning\n- Occurs AFTER reordering predictions by quantile level to ensure proper alignment\n- Happens AFTER handling NA values (lines 480-491)\n- The check uses `diff(predicted) >= 0` to verify monotonic non-decreasing predictions\n\n**Full `bias_quantile_single_vector` Function Structure:**\n```r\nbias_quantile_single_vector <- function(observed, predicted,\n                                        quantile_level, na.rm) {\n  assert_number(observed)\n  \n  # Handle NAs\n  predicted_has_NAs <- anyNA(predicted)\n  quantile_has_NAs <- anyNA(quantile_level)\n  \n  if (any(predicted_has_NAs, quantile_has_NAs)) {\n    if (!na.rm) {\n      return(NA_real_)\n    }\n    quantile_level <- quantile_level[!is.na(predicted)]\n    predicted <- predicted[!is.na(predicted)]\n    predicted <- predicted[!is.na(quantile_level)]\n    quantile_level <- quantile_level[!is.na(quantile_level)]\n  }\n  \n  # ORDER AND CHECK MONOTONICITY\n  order <- order(quantile_level)\n  predicted <- predicted[order]\n  if (!all(diff(predicted) >= 0)) {\n    cli_abort(c(\"!\" = \"Predictions must not be decreasing with increasing quantile level.\"))\n  }\n  \n  # Continue with bias calculation...\n  median_prediction <- interpolate_median(predicted, quantile_level)\n  # ... rest of bias calculation logic\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile` - FULL METHOD\n\n**Location:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast-quantile.R`, lines 81-89\n\n**Exact Code:**\n```r\n#' @export\n#' @rdname assert_forecast\n#' @keywords validate-forecast-object\nassert_forecast.forecast_quantile <- function(\n  forecast, forecast_type = NULL, verbose = TRUE, ...\n) {\n  assert(check_columns_present(forecast, \"quantile_level\"))\n  forecast <- assert_forecast_generic(forecast, verbose)\n  assert_forecast_type(forecast, actual = \"quantile\", desired = forecast_type)\n  assert_numeric(forecast$quantile_level, lower = 0, upper = 1)\n  return(invisible(NULL))\n}\n```\n\n**What It Currently Checks:**\n1. ✅ Presence of `quantile_level` column\n2. ✅ Generic checks via `assert_forecast_generic()` (duplicates, NA count info, column names)\n3. ✅ Forecast type matches expected type\n4. ✅ `quantile_level` values are numeric and in [0, 1] range\n\n**What It Does NOT Check:**\n- ❌ Monotonicity: predictions don't decrease with increasing quantile level\n- ❌ No early warning before scoring\n- ❌ No user-facing diagnostic function\n\n**Connection to Generic Checks (`assert_forecast_generic`):**\nThe generic validation (lines 112-159 of `R/class-forecast.R`) checks:\n- Data is a data.table with min 1 row\n- Columns `observed` and `predicted` present\n- Either `quantile_level` OR `sample_id` present (but not both)\n- No duplicate forecasts\n- NA row handling with vague message: \"Some rows containing NA values may be removed. This is fine if not unexpected.\" (lines 148-152)\n\n---\n\n### 3. TEST PATTERNS - QUANTILE FORECAST TESTS\n\n#### `test-class-forecast-quantile.R` Structure:\n\n**Core Tests (lines 5-67):**\n- Basic conversion: `as_forecast_quantile()` works with various input formats\n- Error handling: missing columns, wrong types, duplicates\n- Rounding issues: handles floating-point rounding in quantile_level\n- Data.frame vs data.table compatibility\n- Conversion from sample forecasts: `as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample()`\n\n**Example Pattern (lines 56-67):**\n```r\ntest_that(\"as_forecast_quantile() function throws an error with duplicate forecasts\", {\n  example <- rbind(\n    example_quantile,\n    example_quantile[1000:1010]\n  )\n\n  expect_error(\n    suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(as_forecast_quantile(example))),\n    \"Assertion on 'data' failed: There are instances with more than one forecast for the same target...\", \n    fixed = TRUE\n  )\n})\n```\n\n#### `test-metrics-quantile.R` - Bias Tests (lines 709-903):\n\n**Test Patterns:**\n```r\n# Lines 837-850: Quantile ordering constraint\ntest_that(\"bias_quantile(): quantiles must be increasing\", {\n  predicted <- 1:4\n  quantiles <- c(0.8, 0.3, 0.5, 0.9)  # BAD: not ordered\n  \n  expect_error(\n    bias_quantile(observed = 3, predicted, quantiles),\n    \"Predictions must not be decreasing with increasing quantile level\"\n  )\n})\n\n# Lines 852-861: Prediction monotonicity constraint\ntest_that(\"bias_quantile(): predictions must be increasing\", {\n  predicted <- c(1, 2, 4, 3)  # BAD: not monotonic\n  quantiles <- c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.9)\n  \n  expect_error(\n    bias_quantile(observed = 3, predicted, quantiles),\n    \"Predictions must not be decreasing with increasing quantile level\"\n  )\n})\n\n# Lines 863-876: Quantile level uniqueness\ntest_that(\"bias_quantile(): quantile levels must be unique\", {\n  predicted <- 1:4\n  quantiles <- c(0.3, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8)  # BAD: duplicates\n  \n  expect_error(\n    bias_quantile(observed = 3, predicted, quantiles),\n    \"Assertion on 'quantile_level' failed: Contains duplicated values, position 2.\"\n  )\n})\n```\n\n**Key Test Conventions:**\n- Use both `expect_error()` and `expect_silent()` for passing cases\n- Suppress messages/warnings in conversion calls: `suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(...))`\n- Test both edge cases (NA handling, matrix input) and error conditions\n- Use `expect_no_condition()` for validation that should pass without output\n\n---\n\n### 4. HELPER PATTERN - `get_duplicate_forecasts()`\n\n**Location:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/get-duplicate-forecasts.R`, lines 19-48\n\n**Full Function:**\n```r\nget_duplicate_forecasts <- function(\n  data,\n  forecast_unit = NULL,\n  counts = FALSE\n) {\n  assert_data_frame(data)\n  data <- ensure_data.table(data)\n\n  if (!is.null(forecast_unit)) {\n    data <- set_forecast_unit(data, forecast_unit)\n  }\n  forecast_unit <- get_forecast_unit(data)\n  available_type <- c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\", \"predicted_label\") %in% colnames(data)\n  type <- c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\", \"predicted_label\")[available_type]\n  data <- as.data.table(data)\n  data[, scoringutils_InternalDuplicateCheck := .N, by = c(forecast_unit, type)]\n  out <- data[scoringutils_InternalDuplicateCheck > 1]\n\n  col <- colnames(data)[\n    colnames(data) %in% c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\", \"predicted_label\")\n  ]\n  setorderv(out, cols = c(forecast_unit, col, \"predicted\"))\n  out[, scoringutils_InternalDuplicateCheck := NULL]\n\n  if (counts) {\n    out <- out[, .(n_duplicates = .N), by = c(get_forecast_unit(out))]\n  }\n\n  return(out[])\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern for `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` to follow:**\n1. Accept `data` (forecast object)\n2. Accept optional `forecast_unit` parameter\n3. Accept optional `counts` parameter (for aggregated output)\n4. Use `get_forecast_unit()` to identify grouping columns\n5. Identify type-specific column (`quantile_level` for quantiles)\n6. Create internal temporary column with computation result\n7. Filter to rows meeting the condition\n8. Clean up and optionally aggregate by forecast unit\n9. Return data.table\n\n**Test Structure (lines 4-21):**\n```r\ntest_that(\"get_duplicate_forecasts() works as expected for quantile\", {\n  expect_no_condition(get_duplicate_forecasts(\n    example_quantile,\n    forecast_unit = c(\"location\", \"target_end_date\", \"target_type\", ...)\n  ))\n\n  expect_identical(nrow(get_duplicate_forecasts(example_quantile)), 0L)\n  expect_identical(\n    nrow(get_duplicate_forecasts(rbind(example_quantile, example_quantile[1000:1010]))),\n    22L\n  )\n})\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. EXAMPLE DATASETS - `example_quantile` STRUCTURE\n\n**Location:** Data file at `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/data/example_quantile.rda`\n\n**Documentation:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast-quantile.R`, lines 271-296\n\n**Columns (from documentation):**\n- `location` - country code (e.g., \"DE\", \"GB\", \"FR\", \"IT\")\n- `target_end_date` - the date for which a prediction was made\n- `target_type` - the target (Cases or Deaths)\n- `observed` - numeric, observed values\n- `location_name` - name of the country\n- `forecast_date` - the date on which a prediction was made\n- `quantile_level` - quantile level of the corresponding prediction\n- `predicted` - predicted value (numeric)\n- `model` - name of the model that generated the forecasts\n- `horizon` - forecast horizon in weeks\n\n**Forecast Unit Columns (from test usage, line 23-31 of test-class-forecast-quantile.R):**\n```r\nforecast_unit = c(\"model\", \"target_type\", \"target_end_date\", \n                  \"horizon\", \"location\")\n```\n\n**Setup File Usage (lines 3-6):**\n```r\nmetrics_no_cov <- get_metrics(\n  example_quantile,\n  exclude = c(\"interval_coverage_50\", \"interval_coverage_90\")\n)\n```\n\n**Data Source:** European Forecast Hub COVID-19 forecasts (PR created from 4 models, filtered to specific locations/dates/horizons)\n\n---\n\n### 6. WARNING PATTERN IN `forecast.R` (Generic NA handling)\n\n**Location:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast.R`, lines 136-156\n\n**Exact Code:**\n```r\n# check whether there are any NA values\nif (anyNA(data)) {\n  if (nrow(na.omit(data)) == 0) {\n    #nolint start: keyword_quote_linter\n    cli_abort(\n      c(\n        \"!\" = \"After removing rows with NA values in the data, no forecasts\n        are left.\"\n      )\n    )\n  }\n  if (verbose) {\n    cli_inform(\n      c(\n        \"i\" = \"Some rows containing NA values may be removed.\n        This is fine if not unexpected.\"\n      )\n    )\n  }\n  #nolint end\n}\n```\n\n**Problem Identified:**\n- The warning at lines 148-152 is **vague** - it doesn't tell users HOW MANY rows with NA will be removed\n- As noted in the ISSUE_TRIAGE.md (issue #537): \"The message in `assert_forecast_generic()` still says the generic 'Some rows containing NA values may be removed' without a row count.\"\n- Issue #895 is related and suggests improving similar messaging for monotonicity issues\n\n---\n\n### 7. ISSUE #895 SUMMARY FROM TRIAGE DOCUMENT\n\n**Issue Number:** 895\n**Title:** Check quantile prediction order helper function\n**Type:** Enhancement\n**Priority:** Medium\n**Complexity:** Small\n**Automatable:** Yes\n**Status:** Still relevant\n\n**Current Status Note:**\n> \"Monotonicity check only exists deep in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (metrics-quantile.R:495) as a hard error. No early warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. No user-facing diagnostic function. Issue #412 is the maintainer-created parent with an agreed plan (steps 1 and 3 not done).\"\n\n**Duplicate/Related Issues:**\n- #412 - \"Add check to `validate_forecast()` that predictions must not decrease with quantile\" (parent issue with agreed plan)\n\n**Agreed Plan:**\n1. Create a user-facing helper function (e.g., `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`)\n2. Identify rows where predictions decrease with increasing quantile level\n3. Add a warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`\n\n**Action Summary (from triage):**\n> \"Create a user-facing helper (e.g., `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`) to identify rows where predictions decrease with increasing quantile level, and add a warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. Resolves both #895 and #412.\"\n\n---\n\n### KEY PATTERNS FOR TEST SPECIFICATION\n\n**1. Error Detection Pattern (used in bias_quantile tests):**\n```r\ntest_that(\"function(): constraint must hold\", {\n  bad_data <- <condition_that_violates_constraint>\n  expect_error(\n    function_call(bad_data),\n    \"Error message text\"\n  )\n  \n  good_data <- <data_meeting_constraint>\n  expect_silent(function_call(good_data))\n})\n```\n\n**2. Helper Function Pattern (for `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`):**\n- Input: forecast object (or raw data)\n- Optional: `forecast_unit` parameter for explicit specification\n- Optional: `counts` parameter for aggregated vs. detailed output\n- Output: data.table with non-monotonic rows OR summary table\n- Ordering: by forecast_unit and quantile columns\n- Cleanup: no temporary internal columns in output\n\n**3. Assertion Pattern (for `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` enhancement):**\n- Check should be non-fatal (warning, not error)\n- Only emit warning if non-monotonic rows detected\n- Message should be clear about what's wrong and how to diagnose\n- Follow the `cli_warn()` pattern with proper formatting\n\n**4. Integration Point:**\n- `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` currently only calls 4 assertions (line 84-87)\n- New check would be added as a 5th assertion\n- Should reuse the new `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` helper\n- Warning should suggest using `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` for diagnosis\n\n---\n\n### SUPPORTING CODE REFERENCES\n\n**Protected Columns Definition (for understanding forecast unit detection):**\n- Located: `R/forecast-unit.R`, lines 57-63\n- `get_forecast_unit()` extracts all columns except protected ones and metrics\n\n**Supported Forecast Unit Columns for Quantile:**\n```r\n# From test-class-forecast-quantile.R lines 23-31\nforecast_unit = c(\"model\", \"target_type\", \"target_end_date\", \n                  \"horizon\", \"location\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### SUMMARY FOR TEST SPECIFICATION WRITING\n\nYou now have:\n1. **Exact monotonicity check code** (lines 493-504 of metrics-quantile.R)\n2. **Current assert_forecast method** that needs enhancement (lines 81-89 of class-forecast-quantile.R)\n3. **Established helper function pattern** (get_duplicate_forecasts as template)\n4. **Real example data structure** (example_quantile with 10 columns)\n5. **Test conventions** used throughout the suite\n6. **Related issues** (#412, #537, #731) providing context on vague warning patterns\n7. **The agreed plan** from maintainers for implementation\n\nThe key insight is that this is a **three-part implementation**:\n- Part A: User-facing diagnostic function `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`\n- Part B: Warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`\n- Part C: Clear messaging patterns learned from NA warning issues"}],"totalDurationMs":96723,"totalTokens":85991,"totalToolUseCount":38,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":777,"cache_read_input_tokens":80802,"output_tokens":4410,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":777,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[]}}}

Resolves both #895 and #412.\n- **Status Note**: Monotonicity check only exists deep in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (metrics-quantile.R:495) as a hard error. No early warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. No user-facing diagnostic function. Issue #412 is the maintainer-created parent with an agreed plan (steps 1 and 3 not done).\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test files**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (existing) and `tests/testthat/test-get-duplicate-forecasts.R` (existing, to add sibling tests for `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat with data.table fixtures; `example_quantile` dataset used extensively; `expect_no_condition()` for passing cases, `expect_error()`/`expect_warning()` for failing cases; `suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(...))` around `as_forecast_quantile()` calls; setup.R pre-computes `scores_quantile` and `metrics_no_cov`; no helper-*.R files exist\n\n## Implementation Context\n\nThe fix has three parts:\n1. **New function `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`** — user-facing diagnostic, modeled on `get_duplicate_forecasts()` (in `R/get-duplicate-forecasts.R`). Takes a forecast object (or data with `quantile_level` and `predicted` columns), groups by forecast unit, orders by `quantile_level` within each group, and returns rows where `predicted` decreases as `quantile_level` increases.\n2. **Warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`** — after the existing 4 checks (line 84-87 of `R/class-forecast-quantile.R`), add a call that detects non-monotonic forecasts and emits `cli_warn()` (not `cli_abort()`), guarded by `verbose`.\n3. **Internal helper `check_monotonicity()`** — analogous to `check_duplicates()`, calls `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` and returns `TRUE` or an error message string. Used by `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`.\n\n---\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() returns empty data.table for well-formed quantile forecasts\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: baseline correctness — well-formed data should produce no results\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (or a new `test-get-non-monotonic-forecasts.R` following the `test-get-duplicate-forecasts.R` naming pattern)\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` directly (built-in dataset with well-formed quantile forecasts)\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(example_quantile)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_identical(nrow(get_non_monotonic_forecasts(example_quantile)), 0L)` — no rows returned\n- Result should be a `data.table`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` does not exist yet; call will error with \"could not find function\"\n\n---\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() detects predictions that decrease with increasing quantile level\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core bug — non-monotonic predictions are not flagged until deep inside `bias_quantile()`\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Create a minimal quantile forecast data.table with one forecast unit having non-monotonic predictions:\n  ```\n  data.table(\n    model = \"model1\",\n    date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"),\n    observed = 5,\n    quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),\n    predicted = c(3, 7, 4)    # 7 > 4 violates monotonicity at q=0.75\n  )\n  ```\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile` using `suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(as_forecast_quantile(...)))`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(data)` on the constructed data\n**Expected**:\n- Result has `nrow > 0` — the non-monotonic forecast unit is returned\n- The returned rows should contain the forecast unit where the violation occurs (model=\"model1\", date=\"2020-01-01\")\n- All quantile rows for that forecast unit should be included (so the user can see the full picture), i.e., `nrow(result) == 3`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n\n---\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() handles multiple forecast units with mixed monotonicity\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: edge case — only some forecast units are non-monotonic; function should return only the bad ones\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Create a data.table with two forecast units:\n  - Unit A (model=\"good_model\", date=\"2020-01-01\"): `quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)`, `predicted = c(2, 5, 8)` — monotonic, well-formed\n  - Unit B (model=\"bad_model\", date=\"2020-01-01\"): `quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)`, `predicted = c(3, 7, 4)` — non-monotonic\n  - Both have `observed = 5`\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(data)`\n**Expected**:\n- Only rows for \"bad_model\" are returned\n- Rows for \"good_model\" are NOT included\n- `nrow(result) == 3` (all 3 quantile rows for the bad forecast unit)\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n\n---\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() works with counts argument\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the `counts` parameter pattern from `get_duplicate_forecasts()`\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Create a data.table with 2 forecast units that are non-monotonic and 1 that is monotonic:\n  - Unit A (model=\"bad1\", date=\"2020-01-01\"): non-monotonic predictions\n  - Unit B (model=\"bad2\", date=\"2020-01-01\"): non-monotonic predictions\n  - Unit C (model=\"good\", date=\"2020-01-01\"): monotonic predictions\n  - All with `quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)`, `observed = 5`\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(data, counts = TRUE)`\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a summary data.table with one row per non-monotonic forecast unit\n- `nrow(result) == 2` (for bad1 and bad2)\n- Contains a count column (e.g., `n_non_monotonic`) indicating the number of quantile rows per affected forecast unit\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n\n---\n\n### Test 5: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() accepts custom forecast_unit argument\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the `forecast_unit` parameter pattern from `get_duplicate_forecasts()`\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` or a crafted dataset with extra columns\n- A custom `forecast_unit` specification that differs from the default\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(data, forecast_unit = c(\"location\", \"target_end_date\", \"target_type\", \"model\"))`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_no_condition(get_non_monotonic_forecasts(example_quantile, forecast_unit = c(\"location\", \"target_end_date\", \"target_type\", \"location_name\", \"forecast_date\", \"model\")))` succeeds\n- Returns 0 rows for the well-formed `example_quantile`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n\n---\n\n### Test 6: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() returns expected class\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: output type contract\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(example_quantile)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_s3_class(result, c(\"data.table\", \"data.frame\"))` — matches the pattern from `get_duplicate_forecasts()`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n\n---\n\n### Test 7: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() works with a plain data.frame input\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: data.frame compatibility (matches `get_duplicate_forecasts()` test pattern)\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Create a data.frame (not data.table) with non-monotonic quantile predictions:\n  ```\n  data.frame(\n    model = \"model1\",\n    date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"),\n    observed = 5,\n    quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),\n    predicted = c(3, 7, 4)\n  )\n  ```\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(df_input)`\n**Expected**:\n- Returns rows identifying the non-monotonic forecast (same as data.table input)\n- Output is a `data.table`/`data.frame`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n\n---\n\n### Test 8: test_that(\"assert_forecast.forecast_quantile() warns about non-monotonic predictions\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core issue — non-monotonic predictions silently pass `assert_forecast()` until they hit `bias_quantile()` deep in `score()`\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (existing)\n**Setup**:\n- Create a data.table with non-monotonic predictions:\n  ```\n  data.table(\n    model = \"model1\",\n    date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"),\n    observed = 5,\n    quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),\n    predicted = c(3, 7, 4)\n  )\n  ```\n**Action**:\n- Call `as_forecast_quantile(data)` which internally calls `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_warning(as_forecast_quantile(data), \"non-monotonic|decreasing|predictions must not be decreasing\")` — a warning (not error) is emitted mentioning non-monotonic predictions\n- The function should still succeed (return a valid `forecast_quantile` object), just with a warning\n- The warning message should mention `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` so users know how to diagnose\n**Fails now because**:\n- Current `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` (lines 81-89 of `R/class-forecast-quantile.R`) has no monotonicity check at all. Non-monotonic data passes silently through `as_forecast_quantile()` and only errors later inside `bias_quantile_single_vector()` at scoring time.\n\n---\n\n### Test 9: test_that(\"assert_forecast.forecast_quantile() does not warn for well-formed data\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: regression guard — well-formed data should not trigger the new warning\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (existing)\n**Setup**:\n- Use `na.omit(data.table::copy(example_quantile))` (known well-formed data)\n**Action**:\n- Call `as_forecast_quantile(data)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_no_condition(as_forecast_quantile(data))` — no warnings or messages emitted\n- This is already partially tested by the existing test at line 19-29 of `test-class-forecast-quantile.R`, but should be explicitly confirmed in the context of the new monotonicity check\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS both before and after the fix. It guards against false positives.\n\n---\n\n### Test 10: test_that(\"assert_forecast.forecast_quantile() suppresses monotonicity warning when verbose = FALSE\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the `verbose` parameter behavior — user should be able to suppress the warning\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (existing)\n**Setup**:\n- Create the same non-monotonic data as Test 8\n- First convert to `forecast_quantile` (suppressing the warning)\n**Action**:\n- Call `assert_forecast(forecast_obj, verbose = FALSE)` on the non-monotonic forecast object\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_no_condition(assert_forecast(forecast_obj, verbose = FALSE))` — no warning emitted when verbose is FALSE\n**Fails now because**:\n- No monotonicity check exists yet; `verbose` parameter has no effect on non-existent check\n\n---\n\n### Test 11: test_that(\"score() works end-to-end with non-monotonic predictions after fix, excluding bias\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the user's pain point — `score()` fails entirely because `bias_quantile()` errors on non-monotonic predictions, preventing all other metrics from being computed\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (existing)\n**Setup**:\n- Create a forecast with non-monotonic predictions in one forecast unit (same data as Test 2)\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile` (suppressing the new warning)\n**Action**:\n- Call `score(data, metrics = list(wis = wis))` — a metric that does NOT require monotonicity\n**Expected**:\n- After the fix, `score()` with non-bias metrics should succeed (WIS does not require monotonicity)\n- `bias_quantile` should still error (or warn) when called individually on non-monotonic data\n- This test verifies that `score()` overall is not broken by non-monotonic data when bias is excluded\n**Fails now because**:\n- Currently `score()` will error with \"Predictions must not be decreasing\" because `bias_quantile` is in the default metrics and its error propagation via `run_safely()` converts to a warning. However, the WIS metric itself does not require monotonicity and should compute fine. The core issue is that the user gets no early warning during `as_forecast_quantile()` — they only discover the problem at `score()` time.\n\n---\n\n### Test 12: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() handles equal predictions at adjacent quantile levels\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: edge case — equal predictions at different quantile levels (flat segments) should NOT be flagged as non-monotonic; only strictly decreasing values are violations\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Create data with flat predictions:\n  ```\n  data.table(\n    model = \"model1\",\n    date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"),\n    observed = 5,\n    quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),\n    predicted = c(3, 5, 5)    # 5 == 5 is OK (non-decreasing)\n  )\n  ```\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(data)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_identical(nrow(result), 0L)` — flat segments are valid (non-decreasing is the requirement, matching `diff(predicted) >= 0` in the existing `bias_quantile` check)\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":270,"cache_read_input_tokens":66713,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":270},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"85af7904-8b76-495a-a761-ec1bec0c63a6","uuid":"124921c3-76d7-4960-8add-5d08a17d9399"}

Takes a forecast object (or data with `quantile_level` and `predicted` columns), groups by forecast unit, orders by `quantile_level` within each group, and returns rows where `predicted` decreases as `quantile_level` increases.\n2. **Warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`** — after the existing 4 checks (line 84-87 of `R/class-forecast-quantile.R`), add a call that detects non-monotonic forecasts and emits `cli_warn()` (not `cli_abort()`), guarded by `verbose`.\n3. **Internal helper `check_monotonicity()`** — analogous to `check_duplicates()`, calls `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` and returns `TRUE` or an error message string. Used by `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`.\n\n---\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() returns empty data.table for well-formed quantile forecasts\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: baseline correctness — well-formed data should produce no results\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (or a new `test-get-non-monotonic-forecasts.R` following the `test-get-duplicate-forecasts.R` naming pattern)\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` directly (built-in dataset with well-formed quantile forecasts)\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(example_quantile)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_identical(nrow(get_non_monotonic_forecasts(example_quantile)), 0L)` — no rows returned\n- Result should be a `data.table`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` does not exist yet; call will error with \"could not find function\"\n\n---\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() detects predictions that decrease with increasing quantile level\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core bug — non-monotonic predictions are not flagged until deep inside `bias_quantile()`\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Create a minimal quantile forecast data.table with one forecast unit having non-monotonic predictions:\n  ```\n  data.table(\n    model = \"model1\",\n    date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"),\n    observed = 5,\n    quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),\n    predicted = c(3, 7, 4)    # 7 > 4 violates monotonicity at q=0.75\n  )\n  ```\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile` using `suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(as_forecast_quantile(...)))`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(data)` on the constructed data\n**Expected**:\n- Result has `nrow > 0` — the non-monotonic forecast unit is returned\n- The returned rows should contain the forecast unit where the violation occurs (model=\"model1\", date=\"2020-01-01\")\n- All quantile rows for that forecast unit should be included (so the user can see the full picture), i.e., `nrow(result) == 3`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n\n---\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() handles multiple forecast units with mixed monotonicity\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: edge case — only some forecast units are non-monotonic; function should return only the bad ones\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Create a data.table with two forecast units:\n  - Unit A (model=\"good_model\", date=\"2020-01-01\"): `quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)`, `predicted = c(2, 5, 8)` — monotonic, well-formed\n  - Unit B (model=\"bad_model\", date=\"2020-01-01\"): `quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)`, `predicted = c(3, 7, 4)` — non-monotonic\n  - Both have `observed = 5`\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(data)`\n**Expected**:\n- Only rows for \"bad_model\" are returned\n- Rows for \"good_model\" are NOT included\n- `nrow(result) == 3` (all 3 quantile rows for the bad forecast unit)\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n\n---\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() works with counts argument\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the `counts` parameter pattern from `get_duplicate_forecasts()`\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Create a data.table with 2 forecast units that are non-monotonic and 1 that is monotonic:\n  - Unit A (model=\"bad1\", date=\"2020-01-01\"): non-monotonic predictions\n  - Unit B (model=\"bad2\", date=\"2020-01-01\"): non-monotonic predictions\n  - Unit C (model=\"good\", date=\"2020-01-01\"): monotonic predictions\n  - All with `quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)`, `observed = 5`\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(data, counts = TRUE)`\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a summary data.table with one row per non-monotonic forecast unit\n- `nrow(result) == 2` (for bad1 and bad2)\n- Contains a count column (e.g., `n_non_monotonic`) indicating the number of quantile rows per affected forecast unit\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n\n---\n\n### Test 5: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() accepts custom forecast_unit argument\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the `forecast_unit` parameter pattern from `get_duplicate_forecasts()`\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` or a crafted dataset with extra columns\n- A custom `forecast_unit` specification that differs from the default\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(data, forecast_unit = c(\"location\", \"target_end_date\", \"target_type\", \"model\"))`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_no_condition(get_non_monotonic_forecasts(example_quantile, forecast_unit = c(\"location\", \"target_end_date\", \"target_type\", \"location_name\", \"forecast_date\", \"model\")))` succeeds\n- Returns 0 rows for the well-formed `example_quantile`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n\n---\n\n### Test 6: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() returns expected class\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: output type contract\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(example_quantile)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_s3_class(result, c(\"data.table\", \"data.frame\"))` — matches the pattern from `get_duplicate_forecasts()`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n\n---\n\n### Test 7: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() works with a plain data.frame input\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: data.frame compatibility (matches `get_duplicate_forecasts()` test pattern)\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Create a data.frame (not data.table) with non-monotonic quantile predictions:\n  ```\n  data.frame(\n    model = \"model1\",\n    date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"),\n    observed = 5,\n    quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),\n    predicted = c(3, 7, 4)\n  )\n  ```\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(df_input)`\n**Expected**:\n- Returns rows identifying the non-monotonic forecast (same as data.table input)\n- Output is a `data.table`/`data.frame`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n\n---\n\n### Test 8: test_that(\"assert_forecast.forecast_quantile() warns about non-monotonic predictions\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core issue — non-monotonic predictions silently pass `assert_forecast()` until they hit `bias_quantile()` deep in `score()`\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (existing)\n**Setup**:\n- Create a data.table with non-monotonic predictions:\n  ```\n  data.table(\n    model = \"model1\",\n    date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"),\n    observed = 5,\n    quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),\n    predicted = c(3, 7, 4)\n  )\n  ```\n**Action**:\n- Call `as_forecast_quantile(data)` which internally calls `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_warning(as_forecast_quantile(data), \"non-monotonic|decreasing|predictions must not be decreasing\")` — a warning (not error) is emitted mentioning non-monotonic predictions\n- The function should still succeed (return a valid `forecast_quantile` object), just with a warning\n- The warning message should mention `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` so users know how to diagnose\n**Fails now because**:\n- Current `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` (lines 81-89 of `R/class-forecast-quantile.R`) has no monotonicity check at all. Non-monotonic data passes silently through `as_forecast_quantile()` and only errors later inside `bias_quantile_single_vector()` at scoring time.\n\n---\n\n### Test 9: test_that(\"assert_forecast.forecast_quantile() does not warn for well-formed data\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: regression guard — well-formed data should not trigger the new warning\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (existing)\n**Setup**:\n- Use `na.omit(data.table::copy(example_quantile))` (known well-formed data)\n**Action**:\n- Call `as_forecast_quantile(data)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_no_condition(as_forecast_quantile(data))` — no warnings or messages emitted\n- This is already partially tested by the existing test at line 19-29 of `test-class-forecast-quantile.R`, but should be explicitly confirmed in the context of the new monotonicity check\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS both before and after the fix. It guards against false positives.\n\n---\n\n### Test 10: test_that(\"assert_forecast.forecast_quantile() suppresses monotonicity warning when verbose = FALSE\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the `verbose` parameter behavior — user should be able to suppress the warning\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (existing)\n**Setup**:\n- Create the same non-monotonic data as Test 8\n- First convert to `forecast_quantile` (suppressing the warning)\n**Action**:\n- Call `assert_forecast(forecast_obj, verbose = FALSE)` on the non-monotonic forecast object\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_no_condition(assert_forecast(forecast_obj, verbose = FALSE))` — no warning emitted when verbose is FALSE\n**Fails now because**:\n- No monotonicity check exists yet; `verbose` parameter has no effect on non-existent check\n\n---\n\n### Test 11: test_that(\"score() works end-to-end with non-monotonic predictions after fix, excluding bias\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the user's pain point — `score()` fails entirely because `bias_quantile()` errors on non-monotonic predictions, preventing all other metrics from being computed\n**File**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-quantile.R` (existing)\n**Setup**:\n- Create a forecast with non-monotonic predictions in one forecast unit (same data as Test 2)\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile` (suppressing the new warning)\n**Action**:\n- Call `score(data, metrics = list(wis = wis))` — a metric that does NOT require monotonicity\n**Expected**:\n- After the fix, `score()` with non-bias metrics should succeed (WIS does not require monotonicity)\n- `bias_quantile` should still error (or warn) when called individually on non-monotonic data\n- This test verifies that `score()` overall is not broken by non-monotonic data when bias is excluded\n**Fails now because**:\n- Currently `score()` will error with \"Predictions must not be decreasing\" because `bias_quantile` is in the default metrics and its error propagation via `run_safely()` converts to a warning. However, the WIS metric itself does not require monotonicity and should compute fine. The core issue is that the user gets no early warning during `as_forecast_quantile()` — they only discover the problem at `score()` time.\n\n---\n\n### Test 12: test_that(\"get_non_monotonic_forecasts() handles equal predictions at adjacent quantile levels\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: edge case — equal predictions at different quantile levels (flat segments) should NOT be flagged as non-monotonic; only strictly decreasing values are violations\n**File**: same as Test 1\n**Setup**:\n- Create data with flat predictions:\n  ```\n  data.table(\n    model = \"model1\",\n    date = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"),\n    observed = 5,\n    quantile_level = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),\n    predicted = c(3, 5, 5)    # 5 == 5 is OK (non-decreasing)\n  )\n  ```\n- Convert to `forecast_quantile`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_non_monotonic_forecasts(data)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_identical(nrow(result), 0L)` — flat segments are valid (non-decreasing is the requirement, matching `diff(predicted) >= 0` in the existing `bias_quantile` check)\n**Fails now because**:\n- Function does not exist yet\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}

No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy.
