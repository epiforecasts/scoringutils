Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    33→| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    34→| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    42→| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

No conversion functions for external packages (Stan, Odin, yardstick, hubverse) exist. The `as_forecast_*` S3 generic system provides extension points for external packages to write their own methods.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

Consensus reached on MVP: add a warning when `get_type(predicted) == \"integer\"`. Discussion also suggested possibly removing `log_score` from default metrics for sample forecasts. | None. All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

The issue concerns the one-to-one correspondence between quantile-format and interval-format metric functions.

No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy.

The multivariate sample class introduced a partial precedent (multiple rows collapse into groups) but by restructuring data before `apply_metrics()`, not by changing it. 2+ years old. | Related to #455 (data frame returns — recommended for closure), #363 (wrapper functions), #338 (cross-type metrics), #941 (rethink `score()` S3), #852 (custom class workflow). | Long-term design question with no clear path forward. The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established. Consider closing as won't-fix or consolidating with #455, #363, #338 into a single milestone-level tracking issue. Any solution requires fundamental changes to `apply_metrics()`. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 360 | Create a wrapper around log score to warn about its use for integer-valued forecasts | implementation-ready | 2023-10-26 | enhancement | medium | small | yes | Still relevant and unaddressed. `logs_sample()` is a thin wrapper with no integer detection or warning. `get_type()` already exists and is used by `bias_sample()` and `pit_histogram_sample()` for the same purpose. Consensus reached on MVP: add a warning when `get_type(predicted) == \"integer\"`. Discussion also suggested possibly removing `log_score` from default metrics for sample forecasts. | None. All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued. Optionally move `log_score` out of the default metric list in `get_metrics.forecast_sample()`. Add targeted tests. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 356 | Documentation: Create a vignette for interactions with other packages | documentation | 2023-10-26 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. No interoperability vignette exists. Deprecated-visualisations vignette mentions hubVis. Hubverse integration moved to external `hubEvals` package (#605, closed). No conversion functions for external packages exist in scoringutils. `as_forecast_*` S3 generics provide extension points for external packages. ~2.5 years old with no progress. | Related to #385 (data transformation for other packages), #852 (custom forecast class workflow), #983 (`.data.frame` methods). | Create a vignette documenting how to use scoringutils with common external packages (hubverse via hubEvals, Stan output, yardstick). Focus on showing the `as_forecast_*()` S3 extension mechanism and practical conversion patterns. Requires editorial decisions on scope and which packages to feature. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 353 | Documentation: Create a vignette that details the different inputs and internal workings of scoringutils | documentation | 2023-10-26 | documentation | medium | large | partially | Still relevant but heavily overlapping with #546, #759, #852. The deleted `scoringutils.Rmd` vignette (PR #836) covered 3 of 4 bullet points; replacement was never written. README \"Quick start\" section partially addresses input formats and workflow. The \"create your own class\" bullet is blocked by prerequisite S3 refactors (#889, #888, #885). Package currently has no introductory or architecture vignette. | Tightly coupled with #546 (simplify getting started) and #759 (replace deleted vignette). \"Create your own class\" aspect depends on #852, blocked by #889, #888, #885. | Consider consolidating with #546 and #759 into a single effort to write a new introductory vignette covering input formats, the `as_forecast_*()` / `score()` workflow, and forecast object anatomy. Defer \"create your own class\" section until S3 extensibility refactors are complete. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 338 | Discussion: Define implementation for metrics which work for different forecast types | help wanted, question, Breaking change | 2023-10-22 | discussion | low | medium | no | Partially addressed by #832 (`get_metrics()` now S3). The remaining question is whether individual metric functions (e.g., `bias_sample`/`bias_quantile`) should also become S3 generics for standalone use. Practical need is low since `score()` already dispatches correctly via `get_metrics.<class>`. 6 conceptual metrics span 2+ forecast types with type-suffixed names. | #832 (done). Related to #455 (vector returns), #941 (rethink `score()` S3). No blockers. | Consider downgrading from \"Breaking change\" since S3 wrappers could be additive. If pursued, create `bias()`, `overprediction()`, `underprediction()`, `dispersion()`, `ae_median()`, `logs()` as S3 generics dispatching on forecast class, keeping suffixed functions as implementations. Defer to future major release. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 329 | Add additional documentation for `crps_sample()`, `logs_sample()` and `dss_sample()` | package improvement | 2023-09-15 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. Formulas exist in the vignette (`scoring-rules.Rmd`) but have not been ported to the roxygen docs for these three functions. Other functions in the same file (e.g., `bias_sample`, `pit_histogram_sample`) already have formula-rich roxygen documentation via `\\deqn{}`, providing a clear template. `dss_sample()` is worst — almost no description beyond \"wrapper.\" | None. Standalone documentation task. | Add `\\deqn{}` mathematical formulas and expanded descriptions to roxygen docs of `crps_sample()`, `logs_sample()`, and `dss_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R`. Adapt formulas from the existing vignette content. `dss_sample()` needs the most work. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 289 | Add support for comparing two distributions | | 2023-07-12 | feature | low | large | no | Still relevant. Zero implementation exists. The entire package architecture assumes scoring against scalar observations. No distribution comparison functions in codebase or in `scoringRules` dependency. Requires fundamental design decisions: new forecast class, new metric functions, and integration approach. 2.5+ years old with zero comments. Filed as an aspirational idea. | Related to #852 (custom forecast class workflow), #889/#888 (S3 extensibility). No issues depend on this. | Design and implement a new forecast class for distribution-to-distribution comparison with associated metrics (energy distance, KL divergence, Wasserstein distance). Should be deferred until S3 extensibility infrastructure (#852, #889, #888) is complete. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 286 | Extension covering idees in \"Model Diagnostics and Forecast Evaluation for Quantiles\" | enhancement, feature request | 2023-05-03 | feature | medium | large | no | Still relevant. None of the three proposed features (consistency-banded coverage plots, Murphy diagrams, CORP reliability diagrams) are implemented. Basic coverage plots and PIT histograms exist but lack the statistical rigor proposed. Paper's code could serve as starting point. ~3 years old with no progress. Design decisions needed on scope, API, and potential new dependencies (e.g., `reliabilitydiag` R package). | Thematically related to #49 (calibration plotting improvement). No hard blockers. @jbracher is already a scoringutils contributor. | Implement three new diagnostic tools from Bracher et al.: (1) add consistency bands and confidence intervals to existing coverage plots, (2) create `murphy_diagram()` function and plot, (3) create CORP reliability diagram function. Consider addressing #49 simultaneously. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 267 | How to score literature/other resources | documentation, help wanted | 2023-02-13 | documentation | low | small | no | Still relevant. Function-level `@references` tags exist across 8 R files, and the scoring-rules vignette has a .bib with 7 papers. However, the agreed-upon deliverable — a standalone, discoverable vignette summarizing scoring methodology and linking to key literature — has not been created. Two vignettes referenced in the README (\"metric-details\", \"scoring-forecasts-directly\") do not exist on disk. ~3 years old. | None blocking. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #789 (customization docs), #666 (update paper). | Create a short standalone vignette summarizing scoring methodology and consolidating all referenced literature into one discoverable place. Link to the full paper and relevant external resources. Also fix the broken vignette links in the README. Requires editorial decisions on content. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 193 | Add more metrics to assess sharpness of forecasts in a sample format | feature request, implementation-ready | 2022-02-16 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `mad_sample()` is the only dedicated sharpness metric. SD and IQR (specifically requested) are not implemented. Both are trivial to add following the `mad_sample()` pattern (data-independent, apply function row-wise over predicted matrix). `dispersion_sample()` (CRPS component) also measures spread but is observation-dependent. `scoringRules` provides no additional sharpness measures. | None. Self-contained addition following existing `mad_sample()` pattern. | Implement `sd_sample()` and `iqr_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R` following the `mad_sample()` pattern. Add both to the default metric list in `get_metrics.forecast_sample()`. Add tests, documentation, and NAMESPACE exports. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 49 | Improve calibration plotting | enhancement, feature request | 2020-07-25 | feature | low | medium | no | Partially addressed. PIT histograms exist via `get_pit_histogram()` (covering item 1 approximately). Items 2 (ACF of PIT values) and 3 (marginal calibration plot) are completely unimplemented. True Talagrand/verification rank histogram also not implemented as a distinct tool. Maintainer said \"no active plan, but nice to have.\" 5+ years old. | Thematically overlaps with #286 (advanced calibration diagnostics). No hard blockers. | Three remaining items: (1) implement verification rank histogram for ensemble/sample forecasts, (2) implement ACF computation/plot for PIT values, (3) implement marginal calibration plot. Consider consolidating with #286 into a single calibration diagnostics tracking issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 37 | Add Diebold Mariano test | enhancement, good first issue, help wanted, feature request | 2020-06-20 | feature | low | small | partially | Still relevant. No DM test implementation exists. `compare_forecasts()` in `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` already has a clean `test_type` dispatch pattern (Wilcoxon and permutation). The DM test's main value-add is proper handling of autocorrelated score differences common in time-series forecasting. Open since 2020 with maintainer agreement but explicitly deferred. | Dependency of #1055 (model confidence sets). Related to #750 (p-value refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #1022 (two-model case). | Add `\"dm\"` as a new `test_type` option in `compare_forecasts()`. Self-implement the DM test statistic (preferred over adding `forecast` dependency) with Newey-West HAC variance estimator. Add tests and documentation. Coordinate naming and autocorrelation lag handling with maintainers. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |","numLines":30,"startLine":100,"totalLines":131}}}

Prediction intervals need to be symmetric around the median and\n#' are characterised by a lower and an upper bound. The lower bound is defined\n#' by the lower quantile and the upper bound is defined by the upper quantile.\n#' A 90% prediction interval, for example, covers 90% of the probability mass\n#' and is defined by the 5% and 95% quantiles. A forecast could therefore\n#' be characterised by one or multiple prediction intervals, e.g. the lower\n#' and upper bounds of the 50% and 90% prediction intervals (corresponding to\n#' the 0.25 and 0.75 as well as the 0.05 and 0.095 quantiles).\n#' @param ...

Update 3 internal call sites, NAMESPACE, docs, and tests.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant. Function exists at `R/helper-quantile-interval-range.R:185` as `@keywords internal`, not exported.

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature). If yes, run `usethis::use_release_issue()` and proceed with CRAN submission. If not, close the issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1064 | Pre-ranking for multivariate calibration assessment | | 2026-01-30 | feature | medium | large | no | No pre-ranking or multivariate calibration diagnostics exist in the codebase. The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al. (2008) as calibration diagnostics for multivariate forecasts, after resolving the API design choice with maintainers. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1057 | Revise README to remove news about the package rewrite | documentation | 2026-01-29 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Open, no assignee. The rewrite messaging and Google Drive paper links appear in 4 locations in README.Rmd. Mechanical edits are straightforward but replacement text requires editorial decisions about where to point users for documentation. | Loosely related to #810 (pkgdown for dev docs) and #759 (future of scoringutils.Rmd vignette). | Edit `README.Rmd` to remove/soften the \"major re-write\" paragraph and replace Google Drive paper links with pointers to package vignettes/docs, then re-render README.md. Confirm preferred documentation hierarchy with maintainers first. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1055 | Model confidence sets | feature request | 2026-01-19 | feature | medium | large | no | Design phase — methodology not yet agreed upon. 6 comments with active debate. Naive pairwise p-value approach acknowledged as incomplete. Three alternatives discussed: Hansen et al. MCS, novel extension for incomplete sets, Bayesian approach. No consensus reached. | Relates to #750 (p-value computation refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #37 (Diebold-Mariano test), #1022 (two-model pairwise). | Resolve design consensus on which MCS methodology to implement (Hansen et al. on complete sets, novel incomplete-set extension, or Bayesian), then implement `get_model_confidence_set()` building on existing pairwise comparison infrastructure. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1046 | multivariate scoring in scoring rules vignette | documentation | 2025-11-04 | documentation | low | small | partially | Open, agreed upon by maintainers. The scoring-rules vignette has zero mentions of multivariate scoring. A dedicated multivariate vignette already exists. Only a cross-reference and brief section are missing. | None. All underlying code and the dedicated multivariate vignette already exist. | Add a short section to `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd` describing the energy score for multivariate forecasts and cross-linking to the existing `scoring-multivariate-forecasts` vignette. No code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1044 | Remove the commented out vignette code. | | 2025-09-23 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Two HTML comment blocks remain: a WIP \"Details on the grouping\" section in `scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` (lines 88-102) and a ~50-line PIT/Calibration section in `scoring-rules.Rmd` (lines 444-493). Originated from PR #998 review comment. | None. | Delete the two HTML-commented-out code blocks from `vignettes/scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` and `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd`. Optionally confirm with maintainers whether the PIT/Calibration text should be preserved elsewhere. | N/A | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1043 | Update print method for multivariate forecasts to show `joint_across` | | 2025-09-21 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output. Update test snapshots. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1026 | as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile | enhancement | 2025-07-13 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples. Requires design decision on approximation method and potential new package dependency. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1022 | Let `get_pairwise_comparison()` run with two models? | | 2025-07-03 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette. The scoring-rules vignette mentions local/global in text only, with no visual. Code to regenerate is in the issue body. | Sibling issues: #929, #930, #933 (all repurpose manuscript illustrations). Consider batching. | Add the existing `score-locality.png` to `scoring-rules.Rmd` (or a new comparative vignette) with an explanatory paragraph on local vs. global scoring rules. Coordinate with #929/#930/#933 for a unified approach. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 933 | Use nice illustration of CRPS/DSS/Log score + the number of samples needed for scores to converge | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `score-convergence-outliers.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned (not referenced by any vignette). Issue #758 contains a detailed draft vignette stub (\"Choosing a scoring rule\") that already references this PNG with prose. Should be batched with siblings #929, #930, #934. | Sibling issues #929, #930, #934. Parent issue #758 (scoring rules explanation vignette). Related to #759 (vignette future). | Create a new \"Choosing a scoring rule\" vignette (per #758's stub) or integrate `score-convergence-outliers.png` into `scoring-rules.Rmd` with explanatory text on sample convergence and score properties. Best addressed as a batch with #929/#930/#934 under #758. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 930 | Use nice illustration of the effect of increasing the mean on increasing average scores | documentation | 2024-09-27 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `illustration-effect-scale.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned. A deleted stub vignette (`Choosing-a-score.Rmd`) once referenced it. Author expressed uncertainty (\"maybe we don't want it anymore\"). Should be batched with siblings #929, #933, #934. | Sibling issues #929, #933, #934. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #759 (vignette future). | Decide whether to integrate `illustration-effect-scale.png` into `scoring-rules.Rmd` or a new \"Choosing a score\" vignette, with text explaining how average scores scale with forecast target magnitude. If unwanted, close and delete orphaned PNG. Address with #929/#933/#934 as batch. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 929 | Use nice illustration of Sharpness and calibration | documentation | 2024-09-27 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. Unlike siblings (#930, #933, #934), the calibration/sharpness PNG does **not** exist in the repo — it was never generated. Code to create it is in the issue body. The `scoring-rules.Rmd` has a commented-out calibration section (lines ~449-492) where this illustration would naturally fit. | Sibling issues #930, #933, #934. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #759 (vignette future), #785 (vignette updates). | Generate `calibration-sharpness-illustration.png` from the code in the issue body, place in `vignettes/`, and integrate into `scoring-rules.Rmd` (or a new \"Choosing a score\" vignette). Coordinate with #930/#933/#934 batch. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 927 | Make all internal columns, in particular `forecast_id`, more robust by prefixing it with \"scoringutils_\" | good first issue, high-priority | 2024-09-26 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. Unprefixed internal columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) risk collision with user data columns. Codebase already mixes two conventions: `.scoringutils_*` (e.g., `.scoringutils_N`) and `scoringutils_Internal*`. ~3 source files, 1 globalVariables file, 1 snapshot to update for `forecast_id` alone. Not a breaking change — all affected columns are internal. | None blocking. Self-contained refactor. | Rename unprefixed internal temp columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) to `.scoringutils_` prefix, matching existing convention. Update `R/helper-quantile-interval-range.R`, `R/metrics-quantile.R`, `R/z-globalVariables.R`, and test snapshots. Also unify the two naming conventions (`.scoringutils_*` vs `scoringutils_Internal*`). | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 922 | remove `check_columns_present` | | 2024-09-25 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `check_columns_present` (and `test_columns_present`) are internal functions with 10 call sites across 9 files. All can be replaced by `checkmate::assert_subset`/`check_subset`/`test_subset` (already a dependency). One call site in `pairwise-comparisons.R:143` uses a custom error message and needs slightly different handling. No user-facing API impact. | Related to #839 (remove `test_columns_not_present`) — both modify `R/check-input-helpers.R`, should be batched. | Replace all 10 call sites of `check_columns_present` (and 1 of `test_columns_present`) with equivalent `checkmate` functions, then delete both functions and their tests. Consider batching with #839. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 909 | Compact version of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` | enhancement, good first issue, help wanted | 2024-09-13 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Already implemented. The `counts` parameter on `get_duplicate_forecasts()` provides exactly the compact output requested. Tests exist. Issue can be closed. | None | Close this issue — the `counts` argument already provides compact/aggregated duplicate output. No further code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 907 | coverage of function factory | enhancement | 2024-09-12 | enhancement | low | small | partially | Still relevant. No factory helper exists. Users must manually use `purrr::partial()` (documented in `score()` docs). Only `interval_coverage` benefits currently. Hard-coded 50% and 90% variants in `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()`. Discussion stalled after 5 comments with no consensus on approach. | Related to #451 (quantile/interval metric organization), #668 (coverage flexibility). | Add either a generic `expand_metric()` utility or a `coverage_ranges` argument to `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()` to programmatically generate multiple parameterized coverage metric variants. Needs design decision on approach given only one metric currently benefits. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 898 | Support for \"Mixture of Parameters\" scoring | feature request | 2024-09-06 | feature | low | large | partially | Still relevant but low urgency. No `forecast_distribution` class exists. Prerequisites #832 (metrics S3 rework) and #846 (ordinal class) are done. Original requester has deprioritized. Would require new class, input format design, dispatch to `scoringRules` parametric functions, and mixture handling. | #888 (S3 rework of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` — minor blocker for clean extensibility). Builds on completed #832, #846. | Implement a new `forecast_distribution` class for scoring forecasts expressed as parametric distributions or mixtures, dispatching to `scoringRules`' closed-form scoring functions. Deferred until active demand — keep on `scoringutils-2.x` milestone. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 895 | Check quantile prediction order helper function | enhancement | 2024-08-19 | enhancement | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. Monotonicity check only exists deep in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (metrics-quantile.R:495) as a hard error. No early warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. No user-facing diagnostic function. Issue #412 is the maintainer-created parent with an agreed plan (steps 1 and 3 not done). | Duplicate of / should be resolved together with #412. | Create a user-facing helper (e.g., `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`) to identify rows where predictions decrease with increasing quantile level, and add a warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. Resolves both #895 and #412. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 889 | Make `get_protected_columns()` S3 to avoid hard-coding things | high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_protected_columns()` is a plain function with a hard-coded superset of all column names for all forecast types. Not S3. Only 2 call sites (both in `forecast-unit.R`). The `intersect()` filter masks the problem but prevents extensibility for new forecast classes. No progress made. | Coordinate with #888 (same S3 pattern for `get_duplicate_forecasts()`). Unblocks #852 (new forecast class workflow). Largely resolves #740 (`get_forecast_unit` customization). | Convert `get_protected_columns()` into an S3 generic with per-class methods so each forecast type declares its own protected columns. Coordinate with #888 for consistent pattern. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 888 | Rework `get_duplicate_forecasts()` to S3 to avoid hard-coding columns and types | high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. Function hard-codes `c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\", \"predicted_label\")` in two places instead of dispatching on S3 class. No work done. Codebase has many S3 precedents now. | Coordinate with #889 (same pattern for `get_protected_columns()`). Partially blocks #898, #852. Related to #740. | Convert `get_duplicate_forecasts()` into an S3 generic with per-class methods where each method knows its own type-specific columns. Retain a `.data.frame`/`.default` method with current column-sniffing logic for backward compatibility. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 885 | Functions to export or make internal | refactor, high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Partially done. `validate_forecast()` already deleted (PR #921). Remaining: `as_forecast_generic()`, `as_scores()`, `apply_metrics()` still internal; `new_forecast()` ambiguously exported with `@keywords internal`. Design decision needed on which functions to export for custom forecast class authors. | Depends on #746 (closed). Blocks custom forecast class creation. Related to #852 (design workflow for new classes). | Decide final export list for custom forecast class API: export `as_forecast_generic()`, `as_scores()`, `apply_metrics()`, resolve ambiguous `new_forecast()` status, and update NAMESPACE. Needs maintainer decision on naming/prefixing. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 880 | Allow users to specify the quantile in `as_forecast_point.forecast_quantile()? | | 2024-07-30 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Function hard-codes `0.5` on two lines (107, 115) in `R/class-forecast-quantile.R`. Design decisions already resolved in PR #876 discussion: parameter name `quantile_level`, default `0.5`, passed via `...`. No work done since issue opened. | None. Self-contained enhancement. | Add a `quantile_level` parameter (default `0.5`) to `as_forecast_point.forecast_quantile()`, replacing the two hard-coded `0.5` references, then add tests and documentation. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 872 | Add a reference for CRPS decomposition approach. | | 2024-07-25 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `crps_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R` has only a `scoringRules` package reference, not one for the decomposition approach. `wis()` already properly cites Bracher et al. 2021. Minor decision needed on which paper(s) to cite: Bracher et al. 2021 and/or Arnold et al. 2023. | Related to #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor). Could be addressed in same PR. | Add `@references` entries to `crps_sample()` roxygen block citing paper(s) formalizing the overprediction/underprediction/dispersion decomposition (likely Bracher et al. 2021 and/or Arnold et al. 2023). | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 870 | Refactor CRPS and WIS decomposition | refactor | 2024-07-22 | refactor | low | medium | partially | Partially addressed. PR #985 (Feb 2025) simplified `crps_sample()` decomposition internally, but the structural duplication remains: `crps_sample()`, `wis()`, and `interval_score()` each independently implement `separate_results` branching, and 6 wrapper functions (3 sample + 3 quantile) repeat identical extraction patterns. | Related to #872 (CRPS decomposition reference). Filed during PR #854 review.

Should be deferred until S3 extensibility infrastructure (#852, #889, #888) is complete. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 286 | Extension covering idees in \"Model Diagnostics and Forecast Evaluation for Quantiles\" | enhancement, feature request | 2023-05-03 | feature | medium | large | no | Still relevant. None of the three proposed features (consistency-banded coverage plots, Murphy diagrams, CORP reliability diagrams) are implemented. Basic coverage plots and PIT histograms exist but lack the statistical rigor proposed. Paper's code could serve as starting point. ~3 years old with no progress. Design decisions needed on scope, API, and potential new dependencies (e.g., `reliabilitydiag` R package). | Thematically related to #49 (calibration plotting improvement). No hard blockers. @jbracher is already a scoringutils contributor. | Implement three new diagnostic tools from Bracher et al.: (1) add consistency bands and confidence intervals to existing coverage plots, (2) create `murphy_diagram()` function and plot, (3) create CORP reliability diagram function.

Function-level `@references` tags exist across 8 R files, and the scoring-rules vignette has a .bib with 7 papers. However, the agreed-upon deliverable — a standalone, discoverable vignette summarizing scoring methodology and linking to key literature — has not been created. Two vignettes referenced in the README (\"metric-details\", \"scoring-forecasts-directly\") do not exist on disk. ~3 years old. | None blocking. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #789 (customization docs), #666 (update paper). | Create a short standalone vignette summarizing scoring methodology and consolidating all referenced literature into one discoverable place. Link to the full paper and relevant external resources. Also fix the broken vignette links in the README.

SD and IQR (specifically requested) are not implemented. Both are trivial to add following the `mad_sample()` pattern (data-independent, apply function row-wise over predicted matrix). `dispersion_sample()` (CRPS component) also measures spread but is observation-dependent. `scoringRules` provides no additional sharpness measures. | None. Self-contained addition following existing `mad_sample()` pattern. | Implement `sd_sample()` and `iqr_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R` following the `mad_sample()` pattern. Add both to the default metric list in `get_metrics.forecast_sample()`. Add tests, documentation, and NAMESPACE exports. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 49 | Improve calibration plotting | enhancement, feature request | 2020-07-25 | feature | low | medium | no | Partially addressed. PIT histograms exist via `get_pit_histogram()` (covering item 1 approximately). Items 2 (ACF of PIT values) and 3 (marginal calibration plot) are completely unimplemented. True Talagrand/verification rank histogram also not implemented as a distinct tool. Maintainer said \"no active plan, but nice to have.\" 5+ years old. | Thematically overlaps with #286 (advanced calibration diagnostics). No hard blockers. | Three remaining items: (1) implement verification rank histogram for ensemble/sample forecasts, (2) implement ACF computation/plot for PIT values, (3) implement marginal calibration plot. Consider consolidating with #286 into a single calibration diagnostics tracking issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 37 | Add Diebold Mariano test | enhancement, good first issue, help wanted, feature request | 2020-06-20 | feature | low | small | partially | Still relevant. No DM test implementation exists. `compare_forecasts()` in `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` already has a clean `test_type` dispatch pattern (Wilcoxon and permutation). The DM test's main value-add is proper handling of autocorrelated score differences common in time-series forecasting. Open since 2020 with maintainer agreement but explicitly deferred. | Dependency of #1055 (model confidence sets). Related to #750 (p-value refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #1022 (two-model case). | Add `\"dm\"` as a new `test_type` option in `compare_forecasts()`. Self-implement the DM test statistic (preferred over adding `forecast` dependency) with Newey-West HAC variance estimator. Add tests and documentation.
