Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking.

No consensus reached. | Relates to #750 (p-value computation refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #37 (Diebold-Mariano test), #1022 (two-model pairwise). | Resolve design consensus on which MCS methodology to implement (Hansen et al. on complete sets, novel incomplete-set extension, or Bayesian), then implement `get_model_confidence_set()` building on existing pairwise comparison infrastructure. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    28→| 1046 | multivariate scoring in scoring rules vignette | documentation | 2025-11-04 | documentation | low | small | partially | Open, agreed upon by maintainers. The scoring-rules vignette has zero mentions of multivariate scoring. A dedicated multivariate vignette already exists. Only a cross-reference and brief section are missing. | None. All underlying code and the dedicated multivariate vignette already exist. | Add a short section to `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd` describing the energy score for multivariate forecasts and cross-linking to the existing `scoring-multivariate-forecasts` vignette.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output. Update test snapshots. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    31→| 1026 | as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile | enhancement | 2025-07-13 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples. Requires design decision on approximation method and potential new package dependency. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    32→| 1022 | Let `get_pairwise_comparison()` run with two models? | | 2025-07-03 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    33→| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    34→| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    42→| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

Consensus reached on MVP: add a warning when `get_type(predicted) == \"integer\"`. Discussion also suggested possibly removing `log_score` from default metrics for sample forecasts. | None. All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

The remaining question is whether individual metric functions (e.g., `bias_sample`/`bias_quantile`) should also become S3 generics for standalone use.

In our example, this forecast is represented by a set of 40 samples from the predictive distribution.\n    22→\n    23→```{r}\n    24→library(scoringutils)\n    25→\n    26→example_univ_single <- example_sample_continuous[\n    27→  target_type == \"Cases\" &\n    28→    location == \"DE\" &\n    29→    forecast_date == \"2021-05-03\" &\n    30→    target_end_date == \"2021-05-15\" &\n    31→    horizon == 2 &\n    32→    model == \"EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble\"\n    33→]\n    34→example_univ_single\n    35→```\n    36→\n    37→We can score this forecast and will receive a single score.\n    38→```{r}\n    39→score(example_univ_single)\n    40→```\n    41→\n    42→Now, of course, we can also score multiple similar forecasts at the same time. Let's say we're not only interested in Germany, but other countries as well.\n    43→\n    44→```{r}\n    45→example_univ_multi <- example_sample_continuous[\n    46→  target_type == \"Cases\" &\n    47→    forecast_date == \"2021-05-03\" &\n    48→    target_end_date == \"2021-05-15\" &\n    49→    horizon == 2 &\n    50→    model == \"EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble\"\n    51→]\n    52→example_univ_multi\n    53→```\n    54→\n    55→Now, we have a set of 4 forecasts for 4 different countries, each of them represented by a set of 40 samples from the predictive distribution.\n    56→\n    57→When we score these forecasts, we will get 4 scores, one for each forecast and observed value.\n    58→```{r}\n    59→score(example_univ_multi)\n    60→```\n    61→\n    62→## Multivariate forecasts\n    63→\n    64→Now, instead of treating the four observations as independent, we could also think of them as a single realisation of a draw from the multivariate distribution of COVID-19 cases across several countries.\n    65→\n    66→The corresponding multivariate forecast would similarly specify a predictive distribution for the number of cases across all 4 countries. The samples are then not draws from four independent distributions, but instead samples from a joint multivariate predictive distribution.\n    67→\n    68→In the following, let's assume that our samples were draws from a multivariate distribution all along (we just treated them as independent for the univariate case).\n    69→\n    70→To tell `scoringutils` that we want to treat these as a multivariate forecast, we need to specify the columns that are pooled together to form a single multivariate forecast. We do this via the `joint_across` argument. For example, if we want to pool forecasts across locations and treat them as a single multivariate forecast, we could set `joint_across = c(\"location\", \"location_name\")` (in our example, the two columns contain essentially the same information - we therefore have to include both in `joint_across` (or could alternatively delete one of them)).\n    71→\n    72→```{r}\n    73→example_multiv <- as_forecast_multivariate_sample(\n    74→  data = example_univ_multi,\n    75→  c(\"location\", \"location_name\")\n    76→)\n    77→example_multiv\n    78→```\n    79→\n    80→The column `.mv_group_id` is created automatically and represents an identifier for each multivariate forecast. `.mv_group_id` is 1 everywhere, because we only have a single multivariate forecast. When scoring this forecast using an appropriate multivariate scoring function, we will get a single score, even though we have 4 observations, one for each country. (Note that for the purposes of scoring, it doesn't matter that sample ids are still 1-40, repeated 4 times, instead of 1-160. `scoringutils` handles this appropriately.)\n    81→\n    82→```{r}\n    83→score(example_multiv)\n    84→```\n    85→\n    86→If, at any point, you want to score the same forecast using different groupings, you'd have create a new separate forecast object with a different grouping and score that new forecast object.\n    87→\n    88→<!-- ## Details on the grouping - WIP\n    89→\n    90→As mentioned above, you can set the grouping with the `set_grouping` function. This will return the original data with an additional column `.mv_group_id` that indicates the group each observation belongs to.\n    91→\n    92→Alternatively, you can set the grouping right when creating the forecast.\n    93→\n    94→\n    95→forecast <- as_forecast_sample(\n    96→  example_sample_continuous,\n    97→  grouping = c(\"target_end_date\", \"target_type\", \"forecast_date\", \"model\", \"horizon\")\n    98→)\n    99→\n   100→forecast -->\n   101→\n   102→\n   103→\n   104→## Univariate and multivariate scoring for matrices\n   105→\n   106→Note: this section may only be relevant to you if you're planning to score forecasts in matrix format.\n   107→\n   108→Let's construct a simple multivariate forecast:\n   109→\n   110→```{r}\n   111→# parameters for multivariate normal example\n   112→set.seed(123)\n   113→d <- 10 # number of dimensions\n   114→m <- 50 # number of samples from multivariate forecast distribution\n   115→\n   116→mu0 <- rep(0, d)\n   117→mu <- rep(1, d)\n   118→\n   119→S0 <- S <- diag(d)\n   120→S0[S0 == 0] <- 0.2\n   121→S[S == 0] <- 0.1\n   122→\n   123→# generate samples from multivariate normal distributions\n   124→obs <- drop(mu0 + rnorm(d) %*% chol(S0))\n   125→fc_sample <- replicate(m, drop(mu + rnorm(d) %*% chol(S)))\n   126→\n   127→obs2 <- drop(mu0 + rnorm(d) %*% chol(S0))\n   128→fc_sample2 <- replicate(m, drop(mu + rnorm(d) %*% chol(S)))\n   129→```\n   130→\n   131→Now, we can compute the Energy Score. Let's compare the `scoringutils` implementation with that of the `scoringRules` package, on which the `scoringutils` implementation is based. The only difference is that `scoringRules` always expects a single multivariate `forecast`, while the `scoringutils` implementation can handle multiple multivariate forecasts together, identified via a grouping vector (assuming they all have the same dimension).\n   132→\n   133→```{r}\n   134→scoringRules::es_sample(y = obs, dat = fc_sample)\n   135→# in the univariate case, Energy Score and CRPS are the same\n   136→# illustration: Evaluate forecast sample for the first variable\n   137→es_sr1 <- scoringRules::es_sample(y = obs, dat = fc_sample)\n   138→es_sr2 <- scoringRules::es_sample(y = obs2, dat = fc_sample2)\n   139→es_sr <- c(es_sr1, es_sr2)\n   140→\n   141→es_su <- energy_score_multivariate(\n   142→  observed = c(obs, obs2),\n   143→  predicted = rbind(fc_sample, fc_sample2),\n   144→  mv_group_id = c(rep(1, d), rep(2, d))\n   145→)\n   146→all.equal(es_sr, es_su, tolerance = 1e-6, check.attributes = FALSE)\n   147→```\n   148→\n   149→You can provide observation weights when computing the Energy Score.\n   150→\n   151→```{r}\n   152→# illustration of observation weights for Energy Score\n   153→# example: equal weights for first half of draws; zero weights for other draws\n   154→w <- rep(c(1, 0), each = 0.5 * m) / (0.5 * m)\n   155→\n   156→es_sr1 <- scoringRules::es_sample(y = obs, dat = fc_sample, w = w)\n   157→es_sr2 <- scoringRules::es_sample(y = obs2, dat = fc_sample2, w = w)\n   158→es_sr <- c(es_sr1, es_sr2)\n   159→\n   160→es_su <- energy_score_multivariate(\n   161→  observed = c(obs, obs2),\n   162→  predicted = rbind(fc_sample, fc_sample2),\n   163→  mv_group_id = c(rep(1, d), rep(2, d)),\n   164→  w = w\n   165→)\n   166→\n   167→all.equal(es_sr, es_su, tolerance = 1e-6, check.attributes = FALSE)\n   168→```\n   169→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_0174TdX1Jz1MSPs1nxdi7zUc","session_id":"63ade341-78a5-409e-98bd-92f276b25b99","uuid":"5c6b2e7b-987f-4c82-8f4b-ad9e9af789d0"}

Let me create a summary document with all the findings.\n\n## Summary Report: Code Relevant to Issue #1043\n\nBased on my thorough exploration of the codebase, here's what I found:\n\n### 1. The Existing `print.forecast` Method\n\n**File:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast.R` (lines 400-465)\n\n```r\nprint.forecast <- function(x, ...) {\n\n  # get forecast type, forecast unit and score columns\n  forecast_type <- try(\n    do.call(get_forecast_type, list(forecast = x)),\n    silent = TRUE\n  )\n  forecast_unit <- try(\n    do.call(get_forecast_unit, list(data = x)),\n    silent = TRUE\n  )\n\n  # Print forecast object information\n  if (inherits(forecast_type, \"try-error\")) {\n    cli_inform(\n      c(\n        \"!\" = \"Could not determine forecast type due to error in validation.\" #nolint\n      )\n    )\n  } else {\n    cli_text(\n      col_blue(\n        \"Forecast type: \"\n      ),\n      \"{forecast_type}\"\n    )\n  }\n\n  if (inherits(forecast_unit, \"try-error\")) {\n    cli_inform(\n      c(\n        \"!\" = \"Could not determine forecast unit.\" #nolint\n      )\n    )\n  } else {\n    cli_text(\n      col_blue(\n        \"Forecast unit:\"\n      )\n    )\n    cli_text(\n      \"{forecast_unit}\"\n    )\n  }\n\n  cat(\"\\n\")\n\n  NextMethod()\n\n  return(invisible(x))\n}\n```\n\n**Key observations:**\n- The method uses `cli_text()` and `col_blue()` for formatting\n- It calls `get_forecast_type()` and `get_forecast_unit()`\n- It then calls `NextMethod()` to delegate to `print.data.table()`\n- Returns the object invisibly\n\n### 2. `forecast_sample_multivariate` Class Definition\n\n**File:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R` (lines 1-77)\n\nThe class is created via:\n```r\nas_forecast_multivariate_sample.default <- function(data,\n                                                    joint_across,\n                                                    forecast_unit = NULL,\n                                                    observed = NULL,\n                                                    predicted = NULL,\n                                                    sample_id = NULL,\n                                                    ...) {\n  data <- as_forecast_generic(\n    data,\n    forecast_unit,\n    observed = observed,\n    predicted = predicted,\n    sample_id = sample_id\n  )\n  data <- set_grouping(data, joint_across)\n\n  data <- new_forecast(data, \"forecast_sample_multivariate\")\n  assert_forecast(data)\n  return(data)\n}\n```\n\n**Class hierarchy:** `forecast_sample_multivariate` -> `forecast` -> `data.table` -> `data.frame`\n\n### 3. `set_grouping()` Function\n\n**File:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R` (lines 215-243)\n\n```r\nset_grouping <- function(data, joint_across) {\n  data <- ensure_data.table(data)\n  assert_character(joint_across, min.len = 1)\n  assert_subset(joint_across, colnames(data))\n\n  by <- setdiff(get_forecast_unit(data), joint_across)\n\n  data[, .mv_group_id := .GRP, by = by]\n\n  existing_keys <- key(data)\n  data[, .scoringutils_count := .N, by = eval(get_forecast_unit(data))]\n\n  for (mv_group_id in unique(data$.mv_group_id)) {\n    counts <- data[.mv_group_id == mv_group_id, .scoringutils_count]\n    unique_counts <- unique(counts)\n\n    if (length(unique_counts) > 1) {\n      cli_abort(\n        \"All univariate forecasts (as defined by the univariate forecast unit)\n        in a group must have the same number of samples.\n        This is not the case for group\n        {.val {mv_group_id}}.

Existing Tests\n\n**File:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R`\n\nNotable tests include:\n- `as_forecast_multivariate_sample() works as expected` (line 4)\n- `as_forecast_multivariate_sample() creates expected structure` (line 23) - includes snapshot test\n- `set_grouping() and get_grouping()` tests (lines 78-149)\n- `score.forecast_sample_multivariate() creates expected output structure` (line 171)\n\nTest setup uses `example_multivariate_sample` as the test data.\n\n### 6. Test Fixtures and Example Data\n\n**File:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/setup.R`\n\nPre-computed example datasets:\n```r\nscores_sample_continuous <- score(example_sample_continuous)\n```\n\nThe main example dataset used is:\n- `example_multivariate_sample` - A COVID-19 multivariate forecast example with columns:\n  - `location`, `target_end_date`, `target_type`, `observed`, `location_name`\n  - `forecast_date`, `model`, `horizon`, `predicted`, `sample_id`, `.mv_group_id`\n  - Created with `joint_across = c(\"location\", \"location_name\")`\n\n### 7. Test Snapshot Files\n\n**File:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/_snaps/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.md`\n\nShows the current print output:\n```\nForecast type: sample_multivariate\nForecast unit:\nlocation, model, target_type, target_end_date, and horizon\n```\n\n**Note:** The current snapshot does NOT show the `joint_across` columns\n\n**File:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/_snaps/class-forecast.md`\n\nShows how other forecast types are printed (binary, quantile, point, sample).\n\n### 8. Key Findings for Issue #1043\n\n1. **`joint_across` is NOT stored as an attribute**: It's computed on-the-fly by `get_grouping()` by identifying columns with constant values within each `.mv_group_id` group.\n\n2. **The complementary concept**: The columns that vary within groups (i.e., `setdiff(forecast_unit, joint_across)`) define the \"grouping\" in the inverse sense.\n\n3. **To retrieve `joint_across` columns for printing**, you would need to:\n   - Get all forecast unit columns\n   - Get the grouping columns (using `get_grouping()`)\n   - Compute: `joint_across = setdiff(get_forecast_unit(forecast), get_grouping(forecast))`\n\n4. **Current print method hierarchy**:\n   - For `forecast_sample_multivariate`, the inherited `print.forecast()` is used\n   - There is NO dedicated `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method yet\n   - The issue requests adding one to display the `joint_across` columns\n\n5. **Test pattern used**:\n   - Tests use `expect_snapshot()` for print output validation\n   - Located in `/tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R`\n   - Snapshots stored in `/tests/testthat/_snaps/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.md`\n\n### 9. How Multivariate Forecasts are Created\n\nFrom the vignette and tests, the typical pattern is:\n```r\nas_forecast_multivariate_sample(\n  data = example_sample_continuous,\n  joint_across = c(\"location\", \"location_name\")\n)\n```\n\nThe `joint_across` parameter specifies which columns should be pooled together to form a single multivariate forecast.\n\nAll file paths are absolute:\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast.R`\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R`\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R`\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/test-class-forecast.R`\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/_snaps/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.md`\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/_snaps/class-forecast.md`\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/vignettes/scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd`"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a952746 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 57445\ntool_uses: 27\nduration_ms: 58238</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"63ade341-78a5-409e-98bd-92f276b25b99","uuid":"2b939c2a-84f5-4113-b1e2-69a27541757e","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the code relevant to issue #1043 in this R package.

Test Fixtures and Example Data\n\n**File:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/setup.R`\n\nPre-computed example datasets:\n```r\nscores_sample_continuous <- score(example_sample_continuous)\n```\n\nThe main example dataset used is:\n- `example_multivariate_sample` - A COVID-19 multivariate forecast example with columns:\n  - `location`, `target_end_date`, `target_type`, `observed`, `location_name`\n  - `forecast_date`, `model`, `horizon`, `predicted`, `sample_id`, `.mv_group_id`\n  - Created with `joint_across = c(\"location\", \"location_name\")`\n\n### 7. Test Snapshot Files\n\n**File:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/_snaps/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.md`\n\nShows the current print output:\n```\nForecast type: sample_multivariate\nForecast unit:\nlocation, model, target_type, target_end_date, and horizon\n```\n\n**Note:** The current snapshot does NOT show the `joint_across` columns\n\n**File:** `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/_snaps/class-forecast.md`\n\nShows how other forecast types are printed (binary, quantile, point, sample).\n\n### 8. Key Findings for Issue #1043\n\n1. **`joint_across` is NOT stored as an attribute**: It's computed on-the-fly by `get_grouping()` by identifying columns with constant values within each `.mv_group_id` group.\n\n2. **The complementary concept**: The columns that vary within groups (i.e., `setdiff(forecast_unit, joint_across)`) define the \"grouping\" in the inverse sense.\n\n3. **To retrieve `joint_across` columns for printing**, you would need to:\n   - Get all forecast unit columns\n   - Get the grouping columns (using `get_grouping()`)\n   - Compute: `joint_across = setdiff(get_forecast_unit(forecast), get_grouping(forecast))`\n\n4. **Current print method hierarchy**:\n   - For `forecast_sample_multivariate`, the inherited `print.forecast()` is used\n   - There is NO dedicated `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method yet\n   - The issue requests adding one to display the `joint_across` columns\n\n5. **Test pattern used**:\n   - Tests use `expect_snapshot()` for print output validation\n   - Located in `/tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R`\n   - Snapshots stored in `/tests/testthat/_snaps/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.md`\n\n### 9. How Multivariate Forecasts are Created\n\nFrom the vignette and tests, the typical pattern is:\n```r\nas_forecast_multivariate_sample(\n  data = example_sample_continuous,\n  joint_across = c(\"location\", \"location_name\")\n)\n```\n\nThe `joint_across` parameter specifies which columns should be pooled together to form a single multivariate forecast.\n\nAll file paths are absolute:\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast.R`\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/R/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R`\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R`\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/test-class-forecast.R`\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/_snaps/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.md`\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/tests/testthat/_snaps/class-forecast.md`\n- `/Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline/vignettes/scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd`"}],"totalDurationMs":58238,"totalTokens":57445,"totalToolUseCount":27,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":709,"cache_read_input_tokens":53960,"output_tokens":2776,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":709,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[]}}}

Update test snapshots.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant. No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute -- `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R` (existing)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat 3 with `expect_snapshot()` for print output validation, data.table fixtures, `example_multivariate_sample` built-in dataset created with `joint_across = c(\"location\", \"location_name\")`. The parent `print.forecast` outputs \"Forecast type:\" and \"Forecast unit:\" as `cli_text()` messages. Existing snapshot for multivariate print is in `_snaps/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.md`.\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"print.forecast_sample_multivariate() displays joint_across columns\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core missing feature -- multivariate print output does not show which columns are jointly forecasted\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_multivariate_sample` directly (already has `joint_across = c(\"location\", \"location_name\")`)\n**Action**:\n- Call `print(example_multivariate_sample)` inside `expect_snapshot()`\n**Expected**:\n- The snapshot output should include a new line showing \"Joint across:\" (or similar label) followed by \"location and location_name\"\n- The existing \"Forecast type: sample_multivariate\" and \"Forecast unit:\" lines should still be present\n- The `joint_across` information should appear as a `cli_text()` message (like forecast type and forecast unit)\n**Fails now because**:\n- No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` S3 method exists. The generic `print.forecast()` is dispatched instead, which only prints forecast type and forecast unit -- it has no awareness of `joint_across` or the `.mv_group_id` grouping structure.\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"print.forecast_sample_multivariate() shows correct joint_across for single-column grouping\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: edge case with a single `joint_across` column\n**Setup**:\n- Create a multivariate forecast from `example_sample_continuous` (after `na.omit()`) with `joint_across = \"location\"` only (not including `location_name`), specifying `forecast_unit = c(\"location\", \"model\", \"target_type\", \"target_end_date\", \"horizon\")`\n**Action**:\n- Call `print(result)` inside `expect_snapshot()`\n**Expected**:\n- The snapshot output should show \"Joint across:\" followed by \"location\" (single column)\n- Forecast type should still be \"sample_multivariate\"\n- Forecast unit should be \"location, model, target_type, target_end_date, and horizon\"\n**Fails now because**:\n- Same as Test 1 -- no dedicated print method exists, so `joint_across` is never displayed regardless of how many columns it contains.\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"print.forecast_sample_multivariate() computes joint_across correctly from grouping\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: verification that the `joint_across` columns are correctly computed as `setdiff(get_forecast_unit(x), get_grouping(x))` minus internal columns\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_multivariate_sample` (created with `joint_across = c(\"location\", \"location_name\")`)\n**Action**:\n- Capture the print output via `expect_snapshot()` and additionally verify programmatically:\n  - Compute `grouping <- get_grouping(example_multivariate_sample)`\n  - Compute `forecast_unit <- get_forecast_unit(example_multivariate_sample)`\n  - Compute `joint_across <- setdiff(forecast_unit, grouping)`\n  - Assert `joint_across` equals `c(\"location\", \"location_name\")` (or equivalent set)\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_true(setequal(joint_across, c(\"location\", \"location_name\")))` passes\n- The print output's \"Joint across:\" line matches these computed columns\n**Fails now because**:\n- While the computation itself (`setdiff(get_forecast_unit(), get_grouping())`) already works correctly, the print method does not call it. This test validates both the computation and its integration into the print output. Currently, the print method does not show `joint_across` at all.\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"print.forecast_sample_multivariate() returns object invisibly\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: standard print method contract (consistent with `print.forecast()`)\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_multivariate_sample`\n**Action**:\n- Call `result <- print(example_multivariate_sample)` (capturing the return value)\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_identical(result, example_multivariate_sample)` -- the print method should return the input object invisibly, matching the behavior of `print.forecast()`\n- The return should be invisible (verified by `expect_invisible(print(example_multivariate_sample))`)\n**Fails now because**:\n- Currently dispatches to `print.forecast()` which does return invisibly. This test ensures the new dedicated method maintains that contract. If the implementer forgets `return(invisible(x))`, this test will catch it.\n\n### Test 5: test_that(\"print.forecast_sample_multivariate() still calls parent print.forecast()\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: regression guard ensuring the new method extends (not replaces) the parent print\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_multivariate_sample`\n**Action**:\n- Call `print(example_multivariate_sample)` inside `expect_snapshot()`\n**Expected**:\n- The output should contain ALL of: (1) \"Forecast type: sample_multivariate\", (2) \"Forecast unit:\" with the unit columns, (3) \"Joint across:\" with the `joint_across` columns, and (4) the data.table print output from `NextMethod()`.\n- Order should be: forecast type, forecast unit, joint across, then the data table.\n**Fails now because**:\n- Without a dedicated `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()`, only (1), (2), and (4) appear. The \"Joint across:\" line (3) is missing entirely.\n\n### Implementation notes for the next agent\n\nThe recommended implementation approach:\n1. Create `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` in `R/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.R`\n2. Inside it, compute `joint_across` as `setdiff(get_forecast_unit(x), get_grouping(x))`\n3. Call the parent `print.forecast()` via `NextMethod()` first (which prints type + unit + data), OR restructure to print type, unit, joint_across, then data\n4. Add `cli_text(col_blue(\"Joint across:\"))` and `cli_text(\"{joint_across}\")` following the existing pattern\n5. Return `invisible(x)`\n6. Add `@export` and update NAMESPACE\n7. Update the existing snapshot in `_snaps/class-forecast-multivariate-sample.md` to reflect the new \"Joint across:\" line\n\nAlternative approach: Store `joint_across` as an attribute during `as_forecast_multivariate_sample.default()` (e.g., `attr(data, \"joint_across\") <- joint_across`) so the print method can retrieve it directly without recomputing. This is more robust but requires updating `set_grouping()` or the constructor.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":289,"cache_read_input_tokens":79122,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":289},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"63ade341-78a5-409e-98bd-92f276b25b99","uuid":"0363d9d3-a173-472d-9e01-c35491b87567"}

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature). If yes, run `usethis::use_release_issue()` and proceed with CRAN submission. If not, close the issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1064 | Pre-ranking for multivariate calibration assessment | | 2026-01-30 | feature | medium | large | no | No pre-ranking or multivariate calibration diagnostics exist in the codebase. The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al. (2008) as calibration diagnostics for multivariate forecasts, after resolving the API design choice with maintainers. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1057 | Revise README to remove news about the package rewrite | documentation | 2026-01-29 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Open, no assignee. The rewrite messaging and Google Drive paper links appear in 4 locations in README.Rmd. Mechanical edits are straightforward but replacement text requires editorial decisions about where to point users for documentation. | Loosely related to #810 (pkgdown for dev docs) and #759 (future of scoringutils.Rmd vignette). | Edit `README.Rmd` to remove/soften the \"major re-write\" paragraph and replace Google Drive paper links with pointers to package vignettes/docs, then re-render README.md. Confirm preferred documentation hierarchy with maintainers first. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1055 | Model confidence sets | feature request | 2026-01-19 | feature | medium | large | no | Design phase — methodology not yet agreed upon. 6 comments with active debate. Naive pairwise p-value approach acknowledged as incomplete. Three alternatives discussed: Hansen et al. MCS, novel extension for incomplete sets, Bayesian approach. No consensus reached. | Relates to #750 (p-value computation refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #37 (Diebold-Mariano test), #1022 (two-model pairwise). | Resolve design consensus on which MCS methodology to implement (Hansen et al. on complete sets, novel incomplete-set extension, or Bayesian), then implement `get_model_confidence_set()` building on existing pairwise comparison infrastructure. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1046 | multivariate scoring in scoring rules vignette | documentation | 2025-11-04 | documentation | low | small | partially | Open, agreed upon by maintainers. The scoring-rules vignette has zero mentions of multivariate scoring. A dedicated multivariate vignette already exists. Only a cross-reference and brief section are missing. | None. All underlying code and the dedicated multivariate vignette already exist. | Add a short section to `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd` describing the energy score for multivariate forecasts and cross-linking to the existing `scoring-multivariate-forecasts` vignette. No code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1044 | Remove the commented out vignette code. | | 2025-09-23 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Two HTML comment blocks remain: a WIP \"Details on the grouping\" section in `scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` (lines 88-102) and a ~50-line PIT/Calibration section in `scoring-rules.Rmd` (lines 444-493). Originated from PR #998 review comment. | None. | Delete the two HTML-commented-out code blocks from `vignettes/scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` and `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd`. Optionally confirm with maintainers whether the PIT/Calibration text should be preserved elsewhere. | N/A | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1043 | Update print method for multivariate forecasts to show `joint_across` | | 2025-09-21 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output. Update test snapshots. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1026 | as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile | enhancement | 2025-07-13 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples. Requires design decision on approximation method and potential new package dependency. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1022 | Let `get_pairwise_comparison()` run with two models? | | 2025-07-03 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette. The scoring-rules vignette mentions local/global in text only, with no visual. Code to regenerate is in the issue body. | Sibling issues: #929, #930, #933 (all repurpose manuscript illustrations). Consider batching. | Add the existing `score-locality.png` to `scoring-rules.Rmd` (or a new comparative vignette) with an explanatory paragraph on local vs. global scoring rules. Coordinate with #929/#930/#933 for a unified approach. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 933 | Use nice illustration of CRPS/DSS/Log score + the number of samples needed for scores to converge | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `score-convergence-outliers.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned (not referenced by any vignette). Issue #758 contains a detailed draft vignette stub (\"Choosing a scoring rule\") that already references this PNG with prose. Should be batched with siblings #929, #930, #934. | Sibling issues #929, #930, #934. Parent issue #758 (scoring rules explanation vignette). Related to #759 (vignette future). | Create a new \"Choosing a scoring rule\" vignette (per #758's stub) or integrate `score-convergence-outliers.png` into `scoring-rules.Rmd` with explanatory text on sample convergence and score properties. Best addressed as a batch with #929/#930/#934 under #758. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 930 | Use nice illustration of the effect of increasing the mean on increasing average scores | documentation | 2024-09-27 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `illustration-effect-scale.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned. A deleted stub vignette (`Choosing-a-score.Rmd`) once referenced it. Author expressed uncertainty (\"maybe we don't want it anymore\"). Should be batched with siblings #929, #933, #934. | Sibling issues #929, #933, #934. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #759 (vignette future). | Decide whether to integrate `illustration-effect-scale.png` into `scoring-rules.Rmd` or a new \"Choosing a score\" vignette, with text explaining how average scores scale with forecast target magnitude. If unwanted, close and delete orphaned PNG. Address with #929/#933/#934 as batch. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 929 | Use nice illustration of Sharpness and calibration | documentation | 2024-09-27 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. Unlike siblings (#930, #933, #934), the calibration/sharpness PNG does **not** exist in the repo — it was never generated. Code to create it is in the issue body. The `scoring-rules.Rmd` has a commented-out calibration section (lines ~449-492) where this illustration would naturally fit. | Sibling issues #930, #933, #934. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #759 (vignette future), #785 (vignette updates). | Generate `calibration-sharpness-illustration.png` from the code in the issue body, place in `vignettes/`, and integrate into `scoring-rules.Rmd` (or a new \"Choosing a score\" vignette). Coordinate with #930/#933/#934 batch. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 927 | Make all internal columns, in particular `forecast_id`, more robust by prefixing it with \"scoringutils_\" | good first issue, high-priority | 2024-09-26 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. Unprefixed internal columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) risk collision with user data columns. Codebase already mixes two conventions: `.scoringutils_*` (e.g., `.scoringutils_N`) and `scoringutils_Internal*`. ~3 source files, 1 globalVariables file, 1 snapshot to update for `forecast_id` alone. Not a breaking change — all affected columns are internal. | None blocking. Self-contained refactor. | Rename unprefixed internal temp columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) to `.scoringutils_` prefix, matching existing convention. Update `R/helper-quantile-interval-range.R`, `R/metrics-quantile.R`, `R/z-globalVariables.R`, and test snapshots. Also unify the two naming conventions (`.scoringutils_*` vs `scoringutils_Internal*`). | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 922 | remove `check_columns_present` | | 2024-09-25 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `check_columns_present` (and `test_columns_present`) are internal functions with 10 call sites across 9 files. All can be replaced by `checkmate::assert_subset`/`check_subset`/`test_subset` (already a dependency). One call site in `pairwise-comparisons.R:143` uses a custom error message and needs slightly different handling. No user-facing API impact. | Related to #839 (remove `test_columns_not_present`) — both modify `R/check-input-helpers.R`, should be batched. | Replace all 10 call sites of `check_columns_present` (and 1 of `test_columns_present`) with equivalent `checkmate` functions, then delete both functions and their tests. Consider batching with #839. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 909 | Compact version of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` | enhancement, good first issue, help wanted | 2024-09-13 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Already implemented. The `counts` parameter on `get_duplicate_forecasts()` provides exactly the compact output requested. Tests exist. Issue can be closed. | None | Close this issue — the `counts` argument already provides compact/aggregated duplicate output. No further code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 907 | coverage of function factory | enhancement | 2024-09-12 | enhancement | low | small | partially | Still relevant. No factory helper exists. Users must manually use `purrr::partial()` (documented in `score()` docs). Only `interval_coverage` benefits currently. Hard-coded 50% and 90% variants in `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()`. Discussion stalled after 5 comments with no consensus on approach. | Related to #451 (quantile/interval metric organization), #668 (coverage flexibility). | Add either a generic `expand_metric()` utility or a `coverage_ranges` argument to `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()` to programmatically generate multiple parameterized coverage metric variants. Needs design decision on approach given only one metric currently benefits. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 898 | Support for \"Mixture of Parameters\" scoring | feature request | 2024-09-06 | feature | low | large | partially | Still relevant but low urgency. No `forecast_distribution` class exists. Prerequisites #832 (metrics S3 rework) and #846 (ordinal class) are done. Original requester has deprioritized. Would require new class, input format design, dispatch to `scoringRules` parametric functions, and mixture handling. | #888 (S3 rework of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` — minor blocker for clean extensibility). Builds on completed #832, #846. | Implement a new `forecast_distribution` class for scoring forecasts expressed as parametric distributions or mixtures, dispatching to `scoringRules`' closed-form scoring functions. Deferred until active demand — keep on `scoringutils-2.x` milestone. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 895 | Check quantile prediction order helper function | enhancement | 2024-08-19 | enhancement | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. Monotonicity check only exists deep in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (metrics-quantile.R:495) as a hard error. No early warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. No user-facing diagnostic function. Issue #412 is the maintainer-created parent with an agreed plan (steps 1 and 3 not done). | Duplicate of / should be resolved together with #412. | Create a user-facing helper (e.g., `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`) to identify rows where predictions decrease with increasing quantile level, and add a warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. Resolves both #895 and #412. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 889 | Make `get_protected_columns()` S3 to avoid hard-coding things | high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_protected_columns()` is a plain function with a hard-coded superset of all column names for all forecast types. Not S3. Only 2 call sites (both in `forecast-unit.R`). The `intersect()` filter masks the problem but prevents extensibility for new forecast classes. No progress made. | Coordinate with #888 (same S3 pattern for `get_duplicate_forecasts()`). Unblocks #852 (new forecast class workflow). Largely resolves #740 (`get_forecast_unit` customization). | Convert `get_protected_columns()` into an S3 generic with per-class methods so each forecast type declares its own protected columns. Coordinate with #888 for consistent pattern. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 888 | Rework `get_duplicate_forecasts()` to S3 to avoid hard-coding columns and types | high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. Function hard-codes `c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\", \"predicted_label\")` in two places instead of dispatching on S3 class. No work done. Codebase has many S3 precedents now. | Coordinate with #889 (same pattern for `get_protected_columns()`). Partially blocks #898, #852. Related to #740. | Convert `get_duplicate_forecasts()` into an S3 generic with per-class methods where each method knows its own type-specific columns. Retain a `.data.frame`/`.default` method with current column-sniffing logic for backward compatibility. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 885 | Functions to export or make internal | refactor, high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Partially done. `validate_forecast()` already deleted (PR #921). Remaining: `as_forecast_generic()`, `as_scores()`, `apply_metrics()` still internal; `new_forecast()` ambiguously exported with `@keywords internal`. Design decision needed on which functions to export for custom forecast class authors. | Depends on #746 (closed). Blocks custom forecast class creation. Related to #852 (design workflow for new classes). | Decide final export list for custom forecast class API: export `as_forecast_generic()`, `as_scores()`, `apply_metrics()`, resolve ambiguous `new_forecast()` status, and update NAMESPACE. Needs maintainer decision on naming/prefixing. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 880 | Allow users to specify the quantile in `as_forecast_point.forecast_quantile()? | | 2024-07-30 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Function hard-codes `0.5` on two lines (107, 115) in `R/class-forecast-quantile.R`. Design decisions already resolved in PR #876 discussion: parameter name `quantile_level`, default `0.5`, passed via `...`. No work done since issue opened. | None. Self-contained enhancement. | Add a `quantile_level` parameter (default `0.5`) to `as_forecast_point.forecast_quantile()`, replacing the two hard-coded `0.5` references, then add tests and documentation. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 872 | Add a reference for CRPS decomposition approach. | | 2024-07-25 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `crps_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R` has only a `scoringRules` package reference, not one for the decomposition approach. `wis()` already properly cites Bracher et al. 2021. Minor decision needed on which paper(s) to cite: Bracher et al. 2021 and/or Arnold et al. 2023. | Related to #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor). Could be addressed in same PR. | Add `@references` entries to `crps_sample()` roxygen block citing paper(s) formalizing the overprediction/underprediction/dispersion decomposition (likely Bracher et al. 2021 and/or Arnold et al. 2023). | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 870 | Refactor CRPS and WIS decomposition | refactor | 2024-07-22 | refactor | low | medium | partially | Partially addressed. PR #985 (Feb 2025) simplified `crps_sample()` decomposition internally, but the structural duplication remains: `crps_sample()`, `wis()`, and `interval_score()` each independently implement `separate_results` branching, and 6 wrapper functions (3 sample + 3 quantile) repeat identical extraction patterns. | Related to #872 (CRPS decomposition reference). Filed during PR #854 review. On `scoringutils-2.x` milestone. | Extract the decomposition logic (`separate_results` branching and wrapper function boilerplate) into a shared internal helper or factory pattern so `crps_sample()`, `wis()`, and `interval_score()` delegate to the same mechanism instead of each implementing it independently. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 852 | Design workflow for creating new forecast classes | enhancement | 2024-07-10 | enhancement | high | large | no | Still relevant. The building blocks exist (`new_forecast()` exported, `as_forecast_generic()` internal, pattern visible in 7 class files) but no documentation, vignette, or guide for third-party class creation exists. Three prerequisite S3 refactors (#889, #888, #740) remain open and block clean extensibility because `get_protected_columns()` and `get_duplicate_forecasts()` hard-code column names, preventing new classes from working seamlessly. `as_forecast_generic()`, `apply_metrics()`, and `as_scores()` are still unexported (#885). | #889 (S3 `get_protected_columns`), #888 (S3 `get_duplicate_forecasts`), #740 (`get_forecast_unit` customization), #885 (export decision for helper functions). | Complete prerequisite S3 refactors (#889, #888), decide export list for class-creation helpers (#885), then write a vignette or article documenting the step-by-step workflow for creating a custom `forecast_*` class (define `as_forecast_<type>`, `assert_forecast.<type>`, `score.<type>`, `get_metrics.<type>`, `get_protected_columns.<type>`, `get_duplicate_forecasts.<type>`). | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 840 | Clean up input checks | | 2024-06-07 | refactor | low | medium | partially | Still relevant.

No hard blockers. @jbracher is already a scoringutils contributor. | Implement three new diagnostic tools from Bracher et al.: (1) add consistency bands and confidence intervals to existing coverage plots, (2) create `murphy_diagram()` function and plot, (3) create CORP reliability diagram function.

PIT histograms exist via `get_pit_histogram()` (covering item 1 approximately). Items 2 (ACF of PIT values) and 3 (marginal calibration plot) are completely unimplemented.
