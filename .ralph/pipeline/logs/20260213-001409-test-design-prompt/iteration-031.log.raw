Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error.

Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site.

WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs.

Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

No conversion functions for external packages (Stan, Odin, yardstick, hubverse) exist. The `as_forecast_*` S3 generic system provides extension points for external packages to write their own methods.

The broad goal is better served by: (1) completing S3 extensibility infrastructure (#852, #983, #889, #888), (2) writing an interoperability vignette (#356), and (3) possibly adding 1-2 zero-dependency convenience converters if demand warrants.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite. A commented-out test skeleton exists in `test-score.R` (lines 51-62). `apply_metrics()` silently overwrites any existing column whose name matches a metric name via `forecast[, (metric_name) := result]`.

Metrics with non-standard I/O (many-to-one like AUC, many-to-many like PIT) cannot fit into `score()`. The PIT case is solved outside `score()` via `get_pit_histogram()`. Zero comments, no design consensus. The multivariate sample class introduced a partial precedent (multiple rows collapse into groups) but by restructuring data before `apply_metrics()`, not by changing it. 2+ years old. | Related to #455 (data frame returns — recommended for closure), #363 (wrapper functions), #338 (cross-type metrics), #941 (rethink `score()` S3), #852 (custom class workflow). | Long-term design question with no clear path forward. The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

Consensus reached on MVP: add a warning when `get_type(predicted) == \"integer\"`. Discussion also suggested possibly removing `log_score` from default metrics for sample forecasts. | None. All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

The remaining question is whether individual metric functions (e.g., `bias_sample`/`bias_quantile`) should also become S3 generics for standalone use.

Related to #455 (vector returns), #941 (rethink `score()` S3). No blockers. | Consider downgrading from \"Breaking change\" since S3 wrappers could be additive. If pursued, create `bias()`, `overprediction()`, `underprediction()`, `dispersion()`, `ae_median()`, `logs()` as S3 generics dispatching on forecast class, keeping suffixed functions as implementations.

Test data typically created inline with `rpois()` (integer) and `rnorm()` (continuous). `get_type()` is the internal helper that detects integer vs continuous predictions. No helper files; setup.R pre-computes `scores_sample_continuous` and `scores_sample_discrete` using `example_sample_continuous` and `example_sample_discrete`.\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"logs_sample() warns when predictions are integer-valued\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core issue — no warning is emitted when users pass integer-valued predictions to `logs_sample()`, even though the log score uses kernel density estimation which is inappropriate for discrete data.\n**Setup**:\n- `observed <- rpois(30, lambda = 1:30)` (integer observed values)\n- `predicted <- replicate(200, rpois(n = 30, lambda = 1:30))` (integer predictions, matrix form)\n**Action**:\n- Call `logs_sample(observed, predicted)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_warning(logs_sample(observed, predicted), <regexp matching the integer warning message>)` — the function should emit a `cli_warn()` indicating that predictions appear to be integer-valued and that the log score may not be appropriate for discrete forecasts.\n- The function should still return a numeric vector of length 30 (warning, not error).\n**Fails now because**:\n- `logs_sample()` (R/metrics-sample.R:224-231) has no `get_type()` check; it passes directly through to `scoringRules::logs_sample()` without any integer detection, so no warning is emitted.\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"logs_sample() does not warn for continuous predictions\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: regression guard — ensures the warning is not incorrectly triggered for continuous predictions.\n**Setup**:\n- `observed <- rnorm(30, mean = 1:30)` (continuous observed values)\n- `predicted <- replicate(200, rnorm(30, mean = 1:30))` (continuous predictions, matrix form)\n**Action**:\n- Call `logs_sample(observed, predicted)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_no_condition(logs_sample(observed, predicted))` — no warning or message should be emitted.\n- Result should be a numeric vector of length 30.\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code (no warning emitted). It serves as a regression guard for the fix.\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"logs_sample() warns for integer-valued predictions even when stored as doubles\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: edge case where predictions are integer-valued but stored as `double` type (e.g., `c(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)` rather than `c(1L, 2L, 3L)`). `get_type()` handles this case — it returns `\"integer\"` when `all.equal(x, as.integer(x))` is `TRUE`.\n**Setup**:\n- `observed <- as.numeric(rpois(30, lambda = 1:30))` (double-stored integer values)\n- `predicted <- matrix(as.numeric(replicate(200, rpois(n = 30, lambda = 1:30))), nrow = 30)` (double-stored integer predictions)\n**Action**:\n- Call `logs_sample(observed, predicted)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_warning(logs_sample(observed, predicted), <regexp matching the integer warning message>)` — should detect that predictions are integer-valued even though they're stored as doubles.\n**Fails now because**:\n- No `get_type()` check exists in `logs_sample()`, so no warning is emitted regardless of prediction type.\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"logs_sample() returns valid scores alongside the integer warning\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: ensures that the warning does not prevent computation — the function should still return valid scores after warning.\n**Setup**:\n- `observed <- rpois(30, lambda = 1:30)` (integer observed values)\n- `predicted <- replicate(200, rpois(n = 30, lambda = 1:30))` (integer predictions)\n**Action**:\n- Call `result <- suppressWarnings(logs_sample(observed, predicted))`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_type(result, \"double\")` — result is numeric\n- `expect_length(result, 30)` — one score per observation\n- `expect_true(all(is.finite(result)))` — no NA/NaN/Inf values (with 200 samples, kernel density estimation should still produce finite scores)\n**Fails now because**:\n- The function already returns valid scores for integer predictions, but this test codifies that the new warning should not break the return value.

No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy.
