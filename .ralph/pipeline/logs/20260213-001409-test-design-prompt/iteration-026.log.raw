Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature). If yes, run `usethis::use_release_issue()` and proceed with CRAN submission.

The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al.

The rewrite messaging and Google Drive paper links appear in 4 locations in README.Rmd. Mechanical edits are straightforward but replacement text requires editorial decisions about where to point users for documentation. | Loosely related to #810 (pkgdown for dev docs) and #759 (future of scoringutils.Rmd vignette). | Edit `README.Rmd` to remove/soften the \"major re-write\" paragraph and replace Google Drive paper links with pointers to package vignettes/docs, then re-render README.md.

No consensus reached. | Relates to #750 (p-value computation refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #37 (Diebold-Mariano test), #1022 (two-model pairwise). | Resolve design consensus on which MCS methodology to implement (Hansen et al. on complete sets, novel incomplete-set extension, or Bayesian), then implement `get_model_confidence_set()` building on existing pairwise comparison infrastructure. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    28→| 1046 | multivariate scoring in scoring rules vignette | documentation | 2025-11-04 | documentation | low | small | partially | Open, agreed upon by maintainers. The scoring-rules vignette has zero mentions of multivariate scoring. A dedicated multivariate vignette already exists. Only a cross-reference and brief section are missing. | None. All underlying code and the dedicated multivariate vignette already exist. | Add a short section to `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd` describing the energy score for multivariate forecasts and cross-linking to the existing `scoring-multivariate-forecasts` vignette.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output. Update test snapshots. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    31→| 1026 | as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile | enhancement | 2025-07-13 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples. Requires design decision on approximation method and potential new package dependency. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    32→| 1022 | Let `get_pairwise_comparison()` run with two models? | | 2025-07-03 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    33→| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    34→| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    42→| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name.

All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`).

The `as_forecast_*` S3 generic system provides extension points for external packages to write their own methods.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite. A commented-out test skeleton exists in `test-score.R` (lines 51-62). `apply_metrics()` silently overwrites any existing column whose name matches a metric name via `forecast[, (metric_name) := result]`.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

Consensus reached on MVP: add a warning when `get_type(predicted) == \"integer\"`. Discussion also suggested possibly removing `log_score` from default metrics for sample forecasts. | None. All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

Example Datasets Used in Tests\n\nThe package uses the following example datasets (all appear to be built-in package data):\n- `example_quantile` - Quantile forecast data\n- `example_binary` - Binary forecast data\n- `example_point` - Point forecast data\n- `example_sample_continuous` - Continuous sample forecast data\n- `example_sample_discrete` - Discrete sample forecast data\n- `example_nominal` - Nominal forecast data\n- `example_quantile_df` - Data frame version of example_quantile (created in setup)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Representative Test Patterns\n\n#### Pattern 1: Testing object creation and validation (test-class-forecast.R)\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"is_forecast() works as expected\", {\n  expect_true(is_forecast(example_binary))\n  expect_true(is_forecast(example_point))\n  expect_true(is_forecast(example_quantile))\n  expect_true(is_forecast(example_sample_continuous))\n  expect_true(is_forecast(example_nominal))\n  \n  expect_false(is_forecast(1:10))\n  expect_false(is_forecast(data.table::as.data.table(example_point)))\n})\n\ntest_that(\"assert_forecast() works as expected\", {\n  expect_error(\n    assert_forecast(data.frame(x = 1:10)),\n    \"The input needs to be a valid forecast object.\"\n  )\n})\n```\n\n#### Pattern 2: Testing metrics computation (test-metrics-binary.R)\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"Binary metrics work within and outside of `score()`\", {\n  result <- score(as_forecast_binary(df))\n  expect_equal(\n    brier_score(observed, predicted),\n    result$brier_score\n  )\n  \n  expect_equal(\n    logs_binary(observed, predicted),\n    result$log_score\n  )\n})\n```\n\n#### Pattern 3: Testing input validation (test-metrics-binary.R)\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"correct input works\", {\n  expect_no_condition(assert_input_binary(observed, predicted))\n  expect_no_condition(assert_input_point(observed_point, predicted_point))\n  \n  expect_no_condition(\n    assert_input_binary(factor(1, levels = c(0, 1)), predicted)\n  )\n})\n\ntest_that(\"function throws an error for wrong input formats\", {\n  expect_error(\n    assert_input_binary(observed = rnorm(10), predicted = predicted),\n    \"Assertion on 'observed' failed: Must be of type 'factor', not 'double'.\"\n  )\n})\n```\n\n#### Pattern 4: Testing score output (test-score.R)\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"Output of `score()` has the class `scores()`\", {\n  expect_no_condition(assert_scores(scores_point))\n  expect_no_condition(assert_scores(scores_binary))\n  expect_no_condition(assert_scores(scores_sample_continuous))\n  expect_no_condition(assert_scores(scores_quantile))\n})\n\ntest_that(\"function produces output for a continuous format case\", {\n  eval <- scores_sample_continuous\n  expect_gt(nrow(eval), 1)\n  expect_identical(nrow(eval), 887L)\n  expect_s3_class(eval, c(\"scores\", \"data.table\", \"data.frame\"), exact = TRUE)\n})\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Assertion Functions Used (testthat conventions)\n\nThe tests use standard `testthat` assertions:\n- `expect_true()` - Check if condition is TRUE\n- `expect_false()` - Check if condition is FALSE\n- `expect_identical()` - Exact equality test\n- `expect_equal()` - Approximate equality test (allows small numeric differences)\n- `expect_error()` - Check that expression throws an error with optional message match\n- `expect_warning()` - Check for warnings\n- `expect_no_condition()` - Check that no warnings or errors occur\n- `expect_no_error()` - Check that no error occurs\n- `expect_gt()` - Check greater than\n- `expect_named()` - Check named arguments\n- `expect_length()` - Check vector/list length\n- `expect_type()` - Check object type\n- `expect_s3_class()` - Check S3 class inheritance with `exact` parameter\n- `expect_null()` - Check for NULL\n- `expect_output()` - Check printed output\n- `expect_contains()` - Check string contains pattern\n- `expect_snapshot()` - Snapshot testing for print output\n\n---\n\n### 5. Function Calls Without `::` Namespace Prefix\n\n**YES - Extensive use of functions called WITHOUT `::` prefixes:**\n\n```r\n# From test-metrics-binary.R - functions called directly:\nbrier_score(observed, predicted)\nlogs_binary(observed, predicted)\nassert_input_binary(observed, predicted)\nassert_input_point(observed_point, predicted_point)\n\n# From test-class-forecast.R - functions called directly:\nis_forecast(example_binary)\nassert_forecast(data.frame(x = 1:10))\nas_forecast_quantile(na.omit(example_quantile))\nget_forecast_type(dat)\nget_forecast_unit(dat)\nscore(example_quantile)\nget_metrics(example_point)\nselect_metrics(get_metrics(example_point), select = \"ape\")\n\n# From test-score.R - functions called directly:\nscore(as_forecast_binary(df))\nas_forecast_binary(df)\nsummarise_scores(scores_binary, by = c(\"model\", \"target_type\"))\n```\n\n**PATTERN:** The tests call package functions **without namespace prefix** (`::`) throughout. This confirms that the tests expect all exported functions to be available in the current environment. Some package-external functions (like `data.table`, `checkmate`, `Metrics`) are called with `::` notation, but scoringutils functions are called directly.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Test Structure and Organization\n\n- **Organization by function/class:** Tests are organized around forecast types (`test-class-forecast-*.R`), metrics (`test-metrics-*.R`), and utility functions\n- **Naming convention:** `test_that(\"description\", { ... })`\n- **Section headers:** Use comments like `# ==============================================================================` to organize test sections\n- **Lint suppressions:** Uses `# nolint:` comments to suppress specific linter warnings (e.g., `commented_code_linter`, `undesirable_operator_linter`)\n- **Data setup:** Creates small test dataframes locally in test functions (e.g., `df`, `observed`, `predicted`) alongside use of pre-computed global data from setup.R\n\n---\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **No helper-*.R files** - All setup happens in a single `setup.R` file\n2. **Pre-computed test data** - Global score objects (`scores_binary`, `scores_quantile`, etc.) are computed once in setup and reused across tests\n3. **Both global and local test data** - Tests mix global pre-computed data with locally-created small test dataframes\n4. **Extensive direct function calls** - Tests call scoringutils functions without `::` prefix, indicating they expect functions to be exported and available\n5. **Error message testing** - Tests frequently validate specific error messages, some with `fixed = TRUE` for exact matches\n6. **Snapshot testing** - Uses `expect_snapshot()` for print output validation\n7. **Data validation focus** - Many tests focus on input validation and error handling via `assert_*` functions\n8. **Multiple assertion strategies** - Combines class checking (`expect_s3_class`), value checking (`expect_identical`, `expect_equal`), and condition checking (`expect_error`, `expect_warning`)"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a588dd3 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 34255\ntool_uses: 22\nduration_ms: 52564</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"808715c1-0a39-4dc0-b462-320649655d88","uuid":"e5a216fa-50de-40c0-b1c0-9f5f5a48fc50","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the testing conventions in the scoringutils R package at /Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline.\n\nPlease research:\n\n1.

The change is behavior-preserving. There is no \"bug\" to reproduce; the primary risk is:\n\n1. A function is not actually imported (would cause \"could not find function\" at runtime)\n2. A function name shadows another package's function (would silently call the wrong function)\n\nExisting test files (`test-pairwise_comparison.R`, `test-metrics-sample.R`, `test-get-correlations.R`, `test-class-forecast-sample.R`, `test-class-forecast-quantile.R`, `test-class-forecast.R`, `test-helper-quantile-interval-range.R`) already exercise all affected code paths. The tests below are supplementary validation that the NAMESPACE is correct and the cleanup is safe.\n\n### Redundant `::` calls to be removed\n\nAll of the following functions are confirmed present in NAMESPACE via `importFrom`:\n\n| File | Line(s) | Redundant Call | NAMESPACE Line |\n|------|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| `R/get-correlations.R` | 103 | `data.table::as.data.table(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,as.data.table)` (L154) |\n| `R/get-correlations.R` | 104 | `data.table::melt(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,melt)` (L161) |\n| `R/class-forecast-sample.R` | 217 | `data.table::dcast(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,dcast)` (L157) |\n| `R/helper-quantile-interval-range.R` | 77 | `data.table::rbindlist(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,rbindlist)` (L163) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 252 | `data.table::rbindlist(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,rbindlist)` (L163) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 334 | `data.table::rbindlist(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,rbindlist)` (L163) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 301 | `data.table::as.data.table(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,as.data.table)` (L154) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 319 | `data.table::copy(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,copy)` (L155) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 327 | `data.table::data.table(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,data.table)` (L156) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 377, 385 | `data.table::setnames(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,setnames)` (L168) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 432 | `data.table::as.data.table(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,as.data.table)` (L154) |\n| `R/metrics-sample.R` | 226 | `scoringRules::logs_sample(...)` | `importFrom(scoringRules,logs_sample)` (L208) |\n| `R/metrics-sample.R` | 258 | `scoringRules::dss_sample(...)` | `importFrom(scoringRules,dss_sample)` (L206) |\n| `R/metrics-sample.R` | 309, 321 | `scoringRules::crps_sample(...)` | `importFrom(scoringRules,crps_sample)` (L205) |\n| `R/class-forecast-quantile.R` | 242 | `cli::cli_warn(...)` | `importFrom(cli,cli_warn)` (L146) |\n| `R/class-forecast-quantile.R` | 208 | `purrr::partial(...)` | `importFrom(purrr,partial)` (L204) |\n| `R/class-forecast.R` | 287 | `data.table::is.data.table(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,is.data.table)` (L159) |\n| `R/class-forecast.R` | 396 | `utils::tail(...)` | `importFrom(utils,tail)` (L224) |\n| `R/metrics-sample.R` | 550 | `cli::cli_warn(...)` | `importFrom(cli,cli_warn)` (L146) |\n\n**Not redundant** (should be verified but likely also imported):\n| `R/metrics-ordinal.R` | 78 | `scoringRules::rps_probs(...)` | `importFrom(scoringRules,rps_probs)` (L209) — this IS imported, so it IS redundant too |\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"all functions used without :: prefix are properly imported in NAMESPACE\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: The risk that removing `::` exposes a missing import\n**Setup**:\n- No special setup needed. Uses the package's own NAMESPACE file and `getNamespaceImports()`.\n**Action**:\n- For each function that will have its `::` prefix removed, verify it is accessible in the scoringutils namespace without qualification:\n  - `exists(\"as.data.table\", envir = asNamespace(\"scoringutils\"), inherits = TRUE)`\n  - Repeat for: `melt`, `dcast`, `rbindlist`, `copy`, `data.table`, `setnames`, `is.data.table`, `logs_sample`, `dss_sample`, `crps_sample`, `cli_warn`, `partial`, `tail`, `rps_probs`\n**Expected**:\n- All `exists()` calls return `TRUE`, confirming every function is available in the package namespace without the `::` prefix.\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code (functions are already imported). It serves as a safety net to confirm the cleanup is valid. If any function were NOT imported, this test would catch it.\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"scoringRules wrapper functions resolve to correct implementations\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: The risk that removing `scoringRules::` prefix causes name collision (since scoringutils exports functions with the SAME names: `logs_sample`, `dss_sample`, `crps_sample`)\n**Setup**:\n- Create small test data: `observed <- rpois(10, lambda = 5)` and `predicted <- replicate(50, rpois(10, lambda = 5))`\n**Action**:\n- Call the scoringutils wrapper functions (`logs_sample()`, `dss_sample()`, `crps_sample()`) with the test data\n- These wrappers internally call `scoringRules::logs_sample()`, etc. After the cleanup, they will call `logs_sample()` without the prefix\n- Verify the wrappers don't accidentally recurse into themselves (infinite recursion) by checking they return numeric vectors of the correct length\n**Expected**:\n- `logs_sample(observed, predicted)` returns a numeric vector of length 10\n- `dss_sample(observed, predicted)` returns a numeric vector of length 10\n- `crps_sample(observed, predicted)` returns a numeric vector of length 10\n- No errors or infinite recursion\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code. **CRITICAL**: After removing the `scoringRules::` prefix from within the wrapper functions, there is a risk of infinite recursion since the wrapper function has the SAME name as the imported function. The implementer MUST verify that R's scoping rules resolve the unqualified call to the imported `scoringRules` function, not to the wrapper itself. If recursion occurs, the `::` prefix must be RETAINED for these three functions. This test will catch that failure.\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"get_correlations() produces correct output after namespace cleanup\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Regression in `get_correlations()` which uses `data.table::as.data.table()` and `data.table::melt()` at lines 103-104\n**Setup**:\n- Use pre-computed `scores_quantile` from `setup.R`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_correlations(summarise_scores(scores_quantile, by = get_forecast_unit(scores_quantile)))`\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a `scores` object (data.table) with metric columns matching the metrics in `scores_quantile`\n- `expect_s3_class(result, c(\"scores\", \"data.table\", \"data.frame\"), exact = TRUE)`\n- No errors or warnings\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code. It is a regression guard ensuring `as.data.table()` and `melt()` resolve correctly after `::` removal.\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"pairwise comparisons produce correct output after namespace cleanup\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Regression in `pairwise-comparisons.R` which has 9 redundant `data.table::` calls\n**Setup**:\n- Use pre-computed `scores_quantile` from `setup.R`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_pairwise_comparisons(scores_quantile, baseline = \"EuroCOVIDhub-baseline\")`\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a data.table with columns including `model`, `compare_against`, `mean_scores_ratio`, `pval`, `adj_pval`, `wis_relative_skill`, `wis_scaled_relative_skill`\n- Numeric results are finite and non-NA\n- `expect_no_condition(...)` — no errors or warnings\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code. It is a regression guard for the many `data.table::` calls in `pairwise-comparisons.R` (`rbindlist`, `as.data.table`, `copy`, `data.table`, `setnames`).\n\n### Test 5: test_that(\"PIT histogram for sample forecasts works after namespace cleanup\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Regression in `class-forecast-sample.R` which uses `data.table::dcast()` at line 217\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_sample_continuous` from the package\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_pit_histogram(as_forecast_sample(example_sample_continuous))`\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a data.table with `density` and `bin` columns\n- Density values are non-negative\n- No errors\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code. It guards the `dcast()` call in `get_pit_histogram.forecast_sample()`.\n\n### Test 6: test_that(\"quantile_to_interval conversion works after namespace cleanup\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Regression in `helper-quantile-interval-range.R` which uses `data.table::rbindlist()` at line 77\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` from the package\n**Action**:\n- Call `score(as_forecast_quantile(na.omit(example_quantile)))` — this exercises the `quantile_to_interval()` internal function which contains the `rbindlist()` call\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a `scores` object with expected metrics (wis, interval_coverage_50, interval_coverage_90, etc.)\n- No errors\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code. It guards the `rbindlist()` call in the quantile-to-interval conversion path.\n\n### Test 7: test_that(\"get_metrics for quantile forecasts resolves partial() correctly\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Regression in `class-forecast-quantile.R` line 208 which uses `purrr::partial()`\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` from the package\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_metrics(as_forecast_quantile(na.omit(example_quantile)))` and verify `interval_coverage_90` is in the result\n- Call the returned `interval_coverage_90` function to verify it's a properly partially-applied `interval_coverage` with `interval_range = 90`\n**Expected**:\n- `\"interval_coverage_90\"` is in `names(metrics)`\n- `metrics$interval_coverage_90` is a function\n- The function has `interval_range` pre-filled to 90 (via `partial()`)\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code. It guards the `purrr::partial()` call in `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()`.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n**CRITICAL WARNING for Test 2 / scoringRules wrappers**: The scoringutils package defines wrapper functions `logs_sample()`, `dss_sample()`, and `crps_sample()` that internally call the identically-named functions from the `scoringRules` package. Currently they use `scoringRules::logs_sample(...)` to explicitly call the external function. If the `scoringRules::` prefix is removed, R's lexical scoping rules mean the unqualified `logs_sample()` call inside the wrapper would refer to... the wrapper itself, causing infinite recursion.\n\n**Recommendation**: The implementer should KEEP the `scoringRules::` prefix on these three functions (`logs_sample`, `dss_sample`, `crps_sample` in `R/metrics-sample.R`) because the wrapper functions shadow the imported names. This is NOT a redundant `::` — it is a necessary disambiguation. The same logic applies to `rps_probs` in `R/metrics-ordinal.R` if there's a wrapper with the same name (check: the function is `rps_ordinal`, not `rps_probs`, so `scoringRules::rps_probs` can safely have its prefix removed).\n\nThis reduces the actual cleanup from ~20 calls to ~15 calls (excluding the 5 scoringRules calls that must keep their prefix).\n\n**Additional note on `utils::tail` in `tail.forecast()`**: The `utils::tail()` call at `R/class-forecast.R:396` is inside an S3 method `tail.forecast()`. Removing the `utils::` prefix would cause infinite recursion since `tail(as.data.table(x), ...)` would dispatch back to `tail.forecast()` if the object still has the forecast class. The `as.data.table()` call should strip the class, but the `utils::` prefix is a safety measure. **Recommendation**: KEEP the `utils::tail` prefix here as well.\n\n**Summary of calls that should KEEP their `::` prefix**:\n- `scoringRules::logs_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R:226` (self-shadowing)\n- `scoringRules::dss_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R:258` (self-shadowing)\n- `scoringRules::crps_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R:309,321` (self-shadowing)\n- `utils::tail()` in `R/class-forecast.R:396` (potential S3 dispatch recursion)\n\n**Summary of calls safe to remove `::` prefix**:\n- All `data.table::` calls (13 instances across 4 files) — no shadowing risk\n- `cli::cli_warn()` (2 instances) — no shadowing risk\n- `purrr::partial()` (1 instance) — no shadowing risk\n- `scoringRules::rps_probs()` (1 instance in `R/metrics-ordinal.R`) — no shadowing, `rps_ordinal` is the wrapper name\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3222,"cache_read_input_tokens":74431,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":3222},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"808715c1-0a39-4dc0-b462-320649655d88","uuid":"4602dae5-ea92-4bdd-a2fe-d23a6926d1e6"}

The tests below are supplementary validation that the NAMESPACE is correct and the cleanup is safe.\n\n### Redundant `::` calls to be removed\n\nAll of the following functions are confirmed present in NAMESPACE via `importFrom`:\n\n| File | Line(s) | Redundant Call | NAMESPACE Line |\n|------|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| `R/get-correlations.R` | 103 | `data.table::as.data.table(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,as.data.table)` (L154) |\n| `R/get-correlations.R` | 104 | `data.table::melt(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,melt)` (L161) |\n| `R/class-forecast-sample.R` | 217 | `data.table::dcast(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,dcast)` (L157) |\n| `R/helper-quantile-interval-range.R` | 77 | `data.table::rbindlist(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,rbindlist)` (L163) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 252 | `data.table::rbindlist(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,rbindlist)` (L163) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 334 | `data.table::rbindlist(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,rbindlist)` (L163) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 301 | `data.table::as.data.table(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,as.data.table)` (L154) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 319 | `data.table::copy(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,copy)` (L155) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 327 | `data.table::data.table(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,data.table)` (L156) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 377, 385 | `data.table::setnames(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,setnames)` (L168) |\n| `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` | 432 | `data.table::as.data.table(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,as.data.table)` (L154) |\n| `R/metrics-sample.R` | 226 | `scoringRules::logs_sample(...)` | `importFrom(scoringRules,logs_sample)` (L208) |\n| `R/metrics-sample.R` | 258 | `scoringRules::dss_sample(...)` | `importFrom(scoringRules,dss_sample)` (L206) |\n| `R/metrics-sample.R` | 309, 321 | `scoringRules::crps_sample(...)` | `importFrom(scoringRules,crps_sample)` (L205) |\n| `R/class-forecast-quantile.R` | 242 | `cli::cli_warn(...)` | `importFrom(cli,cli_warn)` (L146) |\n| `R/class-forecast-quantile.R` | 208 | `purrr::partial(...)` | `importFrom(purrr,partial)` (L204) |\n| `R/class-forecast.R` | 287 | `data.table::is.data.table(...)` | `importFrom(data.table,is.data.table)` (L159) |\n| `R/class-forecast.R` | 396 | `utils::tail(...)` | `importFrom(utils,tail)` (L224) |\n| `R/metrics-sample.R` | 550 | `cli::cli_warn(...)` | `importFrom(cli,cli_warn)` (L146) |\n\n**Not redundant** (should be verified but likely also imported):\n| `R/metrics-ordinal.R` | 78 | `scoringRules::rps_probs(...)` | `importFrom(scoringRules,rps_probs)` (L209) — this IS imported, so it IS redundant too |\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"all functions used without :: prefix are properly imported in NAMESPACE\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: The risk that removing `::` exposes a missing import\n**Setup**:\n- No special setup needed. Uses the package's own NAMESPACE file and `getNamespaceImports()`.\n**Action**:\n- For each function that will have its `::` prefix removed, verify it is accessible in the scoringutils namespace without qualification:\n  - `exists(\"as.data.table\", envir = asNamespace(\"scoringutils\"), inherits = TRUE)`\n  - Repeat for: `melt`, `dcast`, `rbindlist`, `copy`, `data.table`, `setnames`, `is.data.table`, `logs_sample`, `dss_sample`, `crps_sample`, `cli_warn`, `partial`, `tail`, `rps_probs`\n**Expected**:\n- All `exists()` calls return `TRUE`, confirming every function is available in the package namespace without the `::` prefix.\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code (functions are already imported). It serves as a safety net to confirm the cleanup is valid. If any function were NOT imported, this test would catch it.\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"scoringRules wrapper functions resolve to correct implementations\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: The risk that removing `scoringRules::` prefix causes name collision (since scoringutils exports functions with the SAME names: `logs_sample`, `dss_sample`, `crps_sample`)\n**Setup**:\n- Create small test data: `observed <- rpois(10, lambda = 5)` and `predicted <- replicate(50, rpois(10, lambda = 5))`\n**Action**:\n- Call the scoringutils wrapper functions (`logs_sample()`, `dss_sample()`, `crps_sample()`) with the test data\n- These wrappers internally call `scoringRules::logs_sample()`, etc. After the cleanup, they will call `logs_sample()` without the prefix\n- Verify the wrappers don't accidentally recurse into themselves (infinite recursion) by checking they return numeric vectors of the correct length\n**Expected**:\n- `logs_sample(observed, predicted)` returns a numeric vector of length 10\n- `dss_sample(observed, predicted)` returns a numeric vector of length 10\n- `crps_sample(observed, predicted)` returns a numeric vector of length 10\n- No errors or infinite recursion\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code. **CRITICAL**: After removing the `scoringRules::` prefix from within the wrapper functions, there is a risk of infinite recursion since the wrapper function has the SAME name as the imported function. The implementer MUST verify that R's scoping rules resolve the unqualified call to the imported `scoringRules` function, not to the wrapper itself. If recursion occurs, the `::` prefix must be RETAINED for these three functions. This test will catch that failure.\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"get_correlations() produces correct output after namespace cleanup\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Regression in `get_correlations()` which uses `data.table::as.data.table()` and `data.table::melt()` at lines 103-104\n**Setup**:\n- Use pre-computed `scores_quantile` from `setup.R`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_correlations(summarise_scores(scores_quantile, by = get_forecast_unit(scores_quantile)))`\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a `scores` object (data.table) with metric columns matching the metrics in `scores_quantile`\n- `expect_s3_class(result, c(\"scores\", \"data.table\", \"data.frame\"), exact = TRUE)`\n- No errors or warnings\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code. It is a regression guard ensuring `as.data.table()` and `melt()` resolve correctly after `::` removal.\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"pairwise comparisons produce correct output after namespace cleanup\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Regression in `pairwise-comparisons.R` which has 9 redundant `data.table::` calls\n**Setup**:\n- Use pre-computed `scores_quantile` from `setup.R`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_pairwise_comparisons(scores_quantile, baseline = \"EuroCOVIDhub-baseline\")`\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a data.table with columns including `model`, `compare_against`, `mean_scores_ratio`, `pval`, `adj_pval`, `wis_relative_skill`, `wis_scaled_relative_skill`\n- Numeric results are finite and non-NA\n- `expect_no_condition(...)` — no errors or warnings\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code. It is a regression guard for the many `data.table::` calls in `pairwise-comparisons.R` (`rbindlist`, `as.data.table`, `copy`, `data.table`, `setnames`).\n\n### Test 5: test_that(\"PIT histogram for sample forecasts works after namespace cleanup\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Regression in `class-forecast-sample.R` which uses `data.table::dcast()` at line 217\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_sample_continuous` from the package\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_pit_histogram(as_forecast_sample(example_sample_continuous))`\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a data.table with `density` and `bin` columns\n- Density values are non-negative\n- No errors\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code. It guards the `dcast()` call in `get_pit_histogram.forecast_sample()`.\n\n### Test 6: test_that(\"quantile_to_interval conversion works after namespace cleanup\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Regression in `helper-quantile-interval-range.R` which uses `data.table::rbindlist()` at line 77\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` from the package\n**Action**:\n- Call `score(as_forecast_quantile(na.omit(example_quantile)))` — this exercises the `quantile_to_interval()` internal function which contains the `rbindlist()` call\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a `scores` object with expected metrics (wis, interval_coverage_50, interval_coverage_90, etc.)\n- No errors\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code. It guards the `rbindlist()` call in the quantile-to-interval conversion path.\n\n### Test 7: test_that(\"get_metrics for quantile forecasts resolves partial() correctly\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Regression in `class-forecast-quantile.R` line 208 which uses `purrr::partial()`\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` from the package\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_metrics(as_forecast_quantile(na.omit(example_quantile)))` and verify `interval_coverage_90` is in the result\n- Call the returned `interval_coverage_90` function to verify it's a properly partially-applied `interval_coverage` with `interval_range = 90`\n**Expected**:\n- `\"interval_coverage_90\"` is in `names(metrics)`\n- `metrics$interval_coverage_90` is a function\n- The function has `interval_range` pre-filled to 90 (via `partial()`)\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code. It guards the `purrr::partial()` call in `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()`.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n**CRITICAL WARNING for Test 2 / scoringRules wrappers**: The scoringutils package defines wrapper functions `logs_sample()`, `dss_sample()`, and `crps_sample()` that internally call the identically-named functions from the `scoringRules` package. Currently they use `scoringRules::logs_sample(...)` to explicitly call the external function. If the `scoringRules::` prefix is removed, R's lexical scoping rules mean the unqualified `logs_sample()` call inside the wrapper would refer to... the wrapper itself, causing infinite recursion.\n\n**Recommendation**: The implementer should KEEP the `scoringRules::` prefix on these three functions (`logs_sample`, `dss_sample`, `crps_sample` in `R/metrics-sample.R`) because the wrapper functions shadow the imported names. This is NOT a redundant `::` — it is a necessary disambiguation. The same logic applies to `rps_probs` in `R/metrics-ordinal.R` if there's a wrapper with the same name (check: the function is `rps_ordinal`, not `rps_probs`, so `scoringRules::rps_probs` can safely have its prefix removed).\n\nThis reduces the actual cleanup from ~20 calls to ~15 calls (excluding the 5 scoringRules calls that must keep their prefix).\n\n**Additional note on `utils::tail` in `tail.forecast()`**: The `utils::tail()` call at `R/class-forecast.R:396` is inside an S3 method `tail.forecast()`. Removing the `utils::` prefix would cause infinite recursion since `tail(as.data.table(x), ...)` would dispatch back to `tail.forecast()` if the object still has the forecast class. The `as.data.table()` call should strip the class, but the `utils::` prefix is a safety measure. **Recommendation**: KEEP the `utils::tail` prefix here as well.\n\n**Summary of calls that should KEEP their `::` prefix**:\n- `scoringRules::logs_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R:226` (self-shadowing)\n- `scoringRules::dss_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R:258` (self-shadowing)\n- `scoringRules::crps_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R:309,321` (self-shadowing)\n- `utils::tail()` in `R/class-forecast.R:396` (potential S3 dispatch recursion)\n\n**Summary of calls safe to remove `::` prefix**:\n- All `data.table::` calls (13 instances across 4 files) — no shadowing risk\n- `cli::cli_warn()` (2 instances) — no shadowing risk\n- `purrr::partial()` (1 instance) — no shadowing risk\n- `scoringRules::rps_probs()` (1 instance in `R/metrics-ordinal.R`) — no shadowing, `rps_ordinal` is the wrapper name\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}

No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy.

The issue concerns the one-to-one correspondence between quantile-format and interval-format metric functions. Currently: `interval_score()` is internal (not exported), called by `wis()` after `quantile_to_interval()` conversion. Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases.
