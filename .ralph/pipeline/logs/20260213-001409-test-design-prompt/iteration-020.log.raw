Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error.

Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site.

WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    42→| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

The problem is:\n\n1. `assert_input_interval()` uses `cli_warn(..., .frequency = \"once\", .frequency_id = \"small_interval_range\")` \n2. This means the warning fires once per R session\n3. On first `devtools::test()` run, the `expect_warning()` test passes\n4. On subsequent runs in the same R session, the warning has been memoized and won't fire again, so `expect_warning()` fails\n\nThe fix is to call `rlang::reset_message_verbosity(\"small_interval_range\")` before the `expect_warning()` call. Let me also check if there are other tests that test via `check_input_interval` that might also be affected.\n\nLooking at the test file again — line 23-26 tests `assert_input_interval` with `expect_warning()`, and lines 30-38 test `check_input_interval` but use `expect_no_condition()` and `expect_match()` — the `check_input_interval` with a small range would also potentially be affected if it tested for a warning, but it doesn't — it only tests the no-condition and error-message cases.\n\nHowever, there's a subtlety: `check_input_interval` calls `check_try(assert_input_interval(...))` which uses `try()`. The warning from `cli_warn(.frequency = \"once\")` inside `try()` would still fire (warnings aren't caught by `try()`). So if `check_input_interval(observed, lower, upper, 0.5)` is ever called before the `assert_input_interval(observed, lower, upper, 0.5)` test, it could steal the \"once\" warning. But looking at the test order, `assert_input_interval` tests come first.\n\nThe real issue is simpler: repeated `devtools::test()` in the same R session means the second run of the whole test suite finds the `.frequency = \"once\"` already used up from the first run.\n\nNow let me write the test spec file."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":268,"cache_read_input_tokens":60721,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":268},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"180e444e-5c26-4921-9c2e-3d5d76c8c23c","uuid":"284f5d90-ce5b-4efa-9f83-5c0766d2eaa5"}

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature). If yes, run `usethis::use_release_issue()` and proceed with CRAN submission. If not, close the issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1064 | Pre-ranking for multivariate calibration assessment | | 2026-01-30 | feature | medium | large | no | No pre-ranking or multivariate calibration diagnostics exist in the codebase. The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al. (2008) as calibration diagnostics for multivariate forecasts, after resolving the API design choice with maintainers. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1057 | Revise README to remove news about the package rewrite | documentation | 2026-01-29 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Open, no assignee. The rewrite messaging and Google Drive paper links appear in 4 locations in README.Rmd. Mechanical edits are straightforward but replacement text requires editorial decisions about where to point users for documentation. | Loosely related to #810 (pkgdown for dev docs) and #759 (future of scoringutils.Rmd vignette). | Edit `README.Rmd` to remove/soften the \"major re-write\" paragraph and replace Google Drive paper links with pointers to package vignettes/docs, then re-render README.md.

No consensus reached. | Relates to #750 (p-value computation refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #37 (Diebold-Mariano test), #1022 (two-model pairwise). | Resolve design consensus on which MCS methodology to implement (Hansen et al. on complete sets, novel incomplete-set extension, or Bayesian), then implement `get_model_confidence_set()` building on existing pairwise comparison infrastructure. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1046 | multivariate scoring in scoring rules vignette | documentation | 2025-11-04 | documentation | low | small | partially | Open, agreed upon by maintainers. The scoring-rules vignette has zero mentions of multivariate scoring. A dedicated multivariate vignette already exists. Only a cross-reference and brief section are missing. | None. All underlying code and the dedicated multivariate vignette already exist. | Add a short section to `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd` describing the energy score for multivariate forecasts and cross-linking to the existing `scoring-multivariate-forecasts` vignette. No code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1044 | Remove the commented out vignette code. | | 2025-09-23 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Two HTML comment blocks remain: a WIP \"Details on the grouping\" section in `scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` (lines 88-102) and a ~50-line PIT/Calibration section in `scoring-rules.Rmd` (lines 444-493). Originated from PR #998 review comment. | None. | Delete the two HTML-commented-out code blocks from `vignettes/scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` and `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd`. Optionally confirm with maintainers whether the PIT/Calibration text should be preserved elsewhere. | N/A | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1043 | Update print method for multivariate forecasts to show `joint_across` | | 2025-09-21 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output. Update test snapshots. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1026 | as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile | enhancement | 2025-07-13 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples. Requires design decision on approximation method and potential new package dependency. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1022 | Let `get_pairwise_comparison()` run with two models? | | 2025-07-03 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Issue #758 contains a detailed draft vignette stub (\"Choosing a scoring rule\") that already references this PNG with prose. Should be batched with siblings #929, #930, #934. | Sibling issues #929, #930, #934. Parent issue #758 (scoring rules explanation vignette). Related to #759 (vignette future). | Create a new \"Choosing a scoring rule\" vignette (per #758's stub) or integrate `score-convergence-outliers.png` into `scoring-rules.Rmd` with explanatory text on sample convergence and score properties.

Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #759 (vignette future). | Decide whether to integrate `illustration-effect-scale.png` into `scoring-rules.Rmd` or a new \"Choosing a score\" vignette, with text explaining how average scores scale with forecast target magnitude. If unwanted, close and delete orphaned PNG. Address with #929/#933/#934 as batch. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 929 | Use nice illustration of Sharpness and calibration | documentation | 2024-09-27 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. Unlike siblings (#930, #933, #934), the calibration/sharpness PNG does **not** exist in the repo — it was never generated. Code to create it is in the issue body. The `scoring-rules.Rmd` has a commented-out calibration section (lines ~449-492) where this illustration would naturally fit. | Sibling issues #930, #933, #934. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #759 (vignette future), #785 (vignette updates). | Generate `calibration-sharpness-illustration.png` from the code in the issue body, place in `vignettes/`, and integrate into `scoring-rules.Rmd` (or a new \"Choosing a score\" vignette). Coordinate with #930/#933/#934 batch. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 927 | Make all internal columns, in particular `forecast_id`, more robust by prefixing it with \"scoringutils_\" | good first issue, high-priority | 2024-09-26 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. Unprefixed internal columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) risk collision with user data columns. Codebase already mixes two conventions: `.scoringutils_*` (e.g., `.scoringutils_N`) and `scoringutils_Internal*`. ~3 source files, 1 globalVariables file, 1 snapshot to update for `forecast_id` alone. Not a breaking change — all affected columns are internal. | None blocking. Self-contained refactor. | Rename unprefixed internal temp columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) to `.scoringutils_` prefix, matching existing convention. Update `R/helper-quantile-interval-range.R`, `R/metrics-quantile.R`, `R/z-globalVariables.R`, and test snapshots. Also unify the two naming conventions (`.scoringutils_*` vs `scoringutils_Internal*`). | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 922 | remove `check_columns_present` | | 2024-09-25 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `check_columns_present` (and `test_columns_present`) are internal functions with 10 call sites across 9 files. All can be replaced by `checkmate::assert_subset`/`check_subset`/`test_subset` (already a dependency). One call site in `pairwise-comparisons.R:143` uses a custom error message and needs slightly different handling. No user-facing API impact. | Related to #839 (remove `test_columns_not_present`) — both modify `R/check-input-helpers.R`, should be batched. | Replace all 10 call sites of `check_columns_present` (and 1 of `test_columns_present`) with equivalent `checkmate` functions, then delete both functions and their tests. Consider batching with #839. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 909 | Compact version of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` | enhancement, good first issue, help wanted | 2024-09-13 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Already implemented. The `counts` parameter on `get_duplicate_forecasts()` provides exactly the compact output requested. Tests exist. Issue can be closed. | None | Close this issue — the `counts` argument already provides compact/aggregated duplicate output. No further code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 907 | coverage of function factory | enhancement | 2024-09-12 | enhancement | low | small | partially | Still relevant. No factory helper exists. Users must manually use `purrr::partial()` (documented in `score()` docs). Only `interval_coverage` benefits currently. Hard-coded 50% and 90% variants in `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()`. Discussion stalled after 5 comments with no consensus on approach. | Related to #451 (quantile/interval metric organization), #668 (coverage flexibility). | Add either a generic `expand_metric()` utility or a `coverage_ranges` argument to `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()` to programmatically generate multiple parameterized coverage metric variants. Needs design decision on approach given only one metric currently benefits. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 898 | Support for \"Mixture of Parameters\" scoring | feature request | 2024-09-06 | feature | low | large | partially | Still relevant but low urgency. No `forecast_distribution` class exists. Prerequisites #832 (metrics S3 rework) and #846 (ordinal class) are done. Original requester has deprioritized. Would require new class, input format design, dispatch to `scoringRules` parametric functions, and mixture handling. | #888 (S3 rework of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` — minor blocker for clean extensibility). Builds on completed #832, #846. | Implement a new `forecast_distribution` class for scoring forecasts expressed as parametric distributions or mixtures, dispatching to `scoringRules`' closed-form scoring functions. Deferred until active demand — keep on `scoringutils-2.x` milestone. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 895 | Check quantile prediction order helper function | enhancement | 2024-08-19 | enhancement | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. Monotonicity check only exists deep in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (metrics-quantile.R:495) as a hard error. No early warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. No user-facing diagnostic function. Issue #412 is the maintainer-created parent with an agreed plan (steps 1 and 3 not done). | Duplicate of / should be resolved together with #412. | Create a user-facing helper (e.g., `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`) to identify rows where predictions decrease with increasing quantile level, and add a warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`.

The remaining question is whether individual metric functions (e.g., `bias_sample`/`bias_quantile`) should also become S3 generics for standalone use. Practical need is low since `score()` already dispatches correctly via `get_metrics.<class>`. 6 conceptual metrics span 2+ forecast types with type-suffixed names. | #832 (done). Related to #455 (vector returns), #941 (rethink `score()` S3). No blockers. | Consider downgrading from \"Breaking change\" since S3 wrappers could be additive.
