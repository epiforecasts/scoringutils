Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error.

Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site.

WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs.

Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

No conversion functions for external packages (Stan, Odin, yardstick, hubverse) exist. The `as_forecast_*` S3 generic system provides extension points for external packages to write their own methods.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite. A commented-out test skeleton exists in `test-score.R` (lines 51-62). `apply_metrics()` silently overwrites any existing column whose name matches a metric name via `forecast[, (metric_name) := result]`.

Metrics with non-standard I/O (many-to-one like AUC, many-to-many like PIT) cannot fit into `score()`. The PIT case is solved outside `score()` via `get_pit_histogram()`. Zero comments, no design consensus.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

Consensus reached on MVP: add a warning when `get_type(predicted) == \"integer\"`. Discussion also suggested possibly removing `log_score` from default metrics for sample forecasts. | None. All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued.

The remaining question is whether individual metric functions (e.g., `bias_sample`/`bias_quantile`) should also become S3 generics for standalone use.

Optionally integrate into `print.forecast()`.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant. No implementation work done. Function does not exist. Would compute `length(unique(values))` per forecast-unit column (via `get_forecast_unit()`), optionally grouped by model. Similar diagnostic purpose to `get_forecast_counts()` but different output.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-get-unique-values.R` (new)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat + data.table fixtures, example datasets (`example_quantile`, `example_binary`, `example_sample_continuous`, etc.) used directly, `setup.R` pre-computes scores objects, `checkmate::assert_*` used for input validation, snapshot tests used for plot outputs (via `vdiffr`), tests verify types, dimensions, and exact values.\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"get_unique_values() works with a quantile forecast\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: core functionality — returns correct unique value counts for each forecast unit column\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` dataset, passed through `as_forecast_quantile()`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_unique_values(forecast)` with no additional arguments\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a data.table (or data.frame) with at least two columns: one for the column name and one for the count of unique values\n- The column name column should contain exactly the forecast unit columns: `\"location\"`, `\"target_end_date\"`, `\"target_type\"`, `\"location_name\"`, `\"forecast_date\"`, `\"model\"`, `\"horizon\"`\n- The unique value counts should be: location=4, target_end_date=30 (or fewer after NA removal), target_type=2, location_name=4, forecast_date=12 (or fewer), model=5 (or 4 after NA removal), horizon=4\n- Use `expect_s3_class(result, c(\"data.table\", \"data.frame\"))` and `expect_true(\"column\" %in% names(result))` (or equivalent column names the implementation uses)\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_unique_values()` does not exist; calling it produces `Error: could not find function \"get_unique_values\"`\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"get_unique_values() works with different forecast types\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: function works across all forecast types, not just quantile\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_binary` (via `as_forecast_binary()`) and `example_sample_continuous` (via `as_forecast_sample()`)\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_unique_values()` on each forecast object\n**Expected**:\n- For `example_binary`: returns unique counts for its forecast unit columns (location, location_name, target_end_date, target_type, forecast_date, model, horizon). No `quantile_level` or `sample_id` columns should appear (these are protected).\n- For `example_sample_continuous`: same pattern, forecast unit columns only. `sample_id` should not appear in the output (it is a protected column).\n- Both results should be data.tables with the same structure\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_unique_values()` does not exist\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"get_unique_values() returns correct output structure\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: verifies exact output format\n**Setup**:\n- Create a minimal data.table with known values, e.g.:\n  ```\n  data.table(\n    location = c(\"A\", \"A\", \"B\"),\n    model = c(\"m1\", \"m2\", \"m1\"),\n    observed = c(1, 2, 3),\n    predicted = c(1.1, 2.1, 3.1)\n  )\n  ```\n  Convert to a forecast object (e.g., `as_forecast_point()`)\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_unique_values(forecast)` on this minimal forecast\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a data.table with exactly 2 rows (one for `location`, one for `model` — the forecast unit columns)\n- The unique count for `location` is 2 (A, B)\n- The unique count for `model` is 2 (m1, m2)\n- `observed` and `predicted` should NOT appear (they are protected columns)\n- Use `expect_identical()` for exact value matching\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_unique_values()` does not exist\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"get_unique_values() accepts a `by` argument for grouping\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: optional grouping by a column (e.g., by model) to see unique values per group\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` via `as_forecast_quantile()`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_unique_values(forecast, by = \"model\")` (or similar grouping argument)\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a data.table where results are grouped by model\n- Each model has its own row(s) showing unique value counts for the forecast unit columns (excluding \"model\" itself since it's the grouping variable)\n- This tests the optional `by` parameter mentioned in the issue (\"optionally grouped by model\")\n- Use `expect_true(all(c(\"model\") %in% names(result)))` and verify per-model counts are plausible (e.g., some models may cover fewer locations than others)\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_unique_values()` does not exist\n\n### Test 5: test_that(\"get_unique_values() errors on non-forecast input\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: proper input validation\n**Setup**:\n- Use a plain data.frame or character vector that is not a forecast object\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_unique_values(\"not a forecast\")` and `get_unique_values(42)`\n**Expected**:\n- Produces an informative error (e.g., via `cli_abort()` or `checkmate::assert_*`), matching `expect_error(get_unique_values(\"not a forecast\"))`\n- The exact error message pattern depends on implementation, but should mention something about expected input type\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_unique_values()` does not exist\n\n### Test 6: test_that(\"get_unique_values() handles data with NAs correctly\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: edge case where forecast unit columns contain NA values\n**Setup**:\n- Take a copy of `example_quantile`, introduce some `NA` values in a forecast unit column (e.g., set a few `location` values to `NA`)\n- Convert to forecast (this may trigger NA removal via `clean_forecast`, depending on implementation)\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_unique_values()` on the modified forecast\n**Expected**:\n- Function either counts NAs as a distinct value or handles them gracefully (no error)\n- The count for the modified column should be consistent with how `clean_forecast()` / `na.omit()` handles the NAs (if the function uses `clean_forecast` like `get_forecast_counts()` does, NAs would be removed first)\n- Use `expect_no_error()` at minimum\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_unique_values()` does not exist\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":279,"cache_read_input_tokens":59042,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":279},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"16462978-a8ce-4b78-a32b-481f03e65846","uuid":"b3f0387a-b524-4371-8be7-a7dceaffe4ec"}

Similar diagnostic purpose to `get_forecast_counts()` but different output.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-get-unique-values.R` (new)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat + data.table fixtures, example datasets (`example_quantile`, `example_binary`, `example_sample_continuous`, etc.) used directly, `setup.R` pre-computes scores objects, `checkmate::assert_*` used for input validation, snapshot tests used for plot outputs (via `vdiffr`), tests verify types, dimensions, and exact values.\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"get_unique_values() works with a quantile forecast\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: core functionality — returns correct unique value counts for each forecast unit column\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` dataset, passed through `as_forecast_quantile()`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_unique_values(forecast)` with no additional arguments\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a data.table (or data.frame) with at least two columns: one for the column name and one for the count of unique values\n- The column name column should contain exactly the forecast unit columns: `\"location\"`, `\"target_end_date\"`, `\"target_type\"`, `\"location_name\"`, `\"forecast_date\"`, `\"model\"`, `\"horizon\"`\n- The unique value counts should be: location=4, target_end_date=30 (or fewer after NA removal), target_type=2, location_name=4, forecast_date=12 (or fewer), model=5 (or 4 after NA removal), horizon=4\n- Use `expect_s3_class(result, c(\"data.table\", \"data.frame\"))` and `expect_true(\"column\" %in% names(result))` (or equivalent column names the implementation uses)\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_unique_values()` does not exist; calling it produces `Error: could not find function \"get_unique_values\"`\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"get_unique_values() works with different forecast types\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: function works across all forecast types, not just quantile\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_binary` (via `as_forecast_binary()`) and `example_sample_continuous` (via `as_forecast_sample()`)\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_unique_values()` on each forecast object\n**Expected**:\n- For `example_binary`: returns unique counts for its forecast unit columns (location, location_name, target_end_date, target_type, forecast_date, model, horizon). No `quantile_level` or `sample_id` columns should appear (these are protected).\n- For `example_sample_continuous`: same pattern, forecast unit columns only. `sample_id` should not appear in the output (it is a protected column).\n- Both results should be data.tables with the same structure\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_unique_values()` does not exist\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"get_unique_values() returns correct output structure\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: verifies exact output format\n**Setup**:\n- Create a minimal data.table with known values, e.g.:\n  ```\n  data.table(\n    location = c(\"A\", \"A\", \"B\"),\n    model = c(\"m1\", \"m2\", \"m1\"),\n    observed = c(1, 2, 3),\n    predicted = c(1.1, 2.1, 3.1)\n  )\n  ```\n  Convert to a forecast object (e.g., `as_forecast_point()`)\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_unique_values(forecast)` on this minimal forecast\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a data.table with exactly 2 rows (one for `location`, one for `model` — the forecast unit columns)\n- The unique count for `location` is 2 (A, B)\n- The unique count for `model` is 2 (m1, m2)\n- `observed` and `predicted` should NOT appear (they are protected columns)\n- Use `expect_identical()` for exact value matching\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_unique_values()` does not exist\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"get_unique_values() accepts a `by` argument for grouping\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: optional grouping by a column (e.g., by model) to see unique values per group\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_quantile` via `as_forecast_quantile()`\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_unique_values(forecast, by = \"model\")` (or similar grouping argument)\n**Expected**:\n- Returns a data.table where results are grouped by model\n- Each model has its own row(s) showing unique value counts for the forecast unit columns (excluding \"model\" itself since it's the grouping variable)\n- This tests the optional `by` parameter mentioned in the issue (\"optionally grouped by model\")\n- Use `expect_true(all(c(\"model\") %in% names(result)))` and verify per-model counts are plausible (e.g., some models may cover fewer locations than others)\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_unique_values()` does not exist\n\n### Test 5: test_that(\"get_unique_values() errors on non-forecast input\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: proper input validation\n**Setup**:\n- Use a plain data.frame or character vector that is not a forecast object\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_unique_values(\"not a forecast\")` and `get_unique_values(42)`\n**Expected**:\n- Produces an informative error (e.g., via `cli_abort()` or `checkmate::assert_*`), matching `expect_error(get_unique_values(\"not a forecast\"))`\n- The exact error message pattern depends on implementation, but should mention something about expected input type\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_unique_values()` does not exist\n\n### Test 6: test_that(\"get_unique_values() handles data with NAs correctly\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: edge case where forecast unit columns contain NA values\n**Setup**:\n- Take a copy of `example_quantile`, introduce some `NA` values in a forecast unit column (e.g., set a few `location` values to `NA`)\n- Convert to forecast (this may trigger NA removal via `clean_forecast`, depending on implementation)\n**Action**:\n- Call `get_unique_values()` on the modified forecast\n**Expected**:\n- Function either counts NAs as a distinct value or handles them gracefully (no error)\n- The count for the modified column should be consistent with how `clean_forecast()` / `na.omit()` handles the NAs (if the function uses `clean_forecast` like `get_forecast_counts()` does, NAs would be removed first)\n- Use `expect_no_error()` at minimum\n**Fails now because**:\n- `get_unique_values()` does not exist\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns.

The issue concerns the one-to-one correspondence between quantile-format and interval-format metric functions. Currently: `interval_score()` is internal (not exported), called by `wis()` after `quantile_to_interval()` conversion. Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases.
