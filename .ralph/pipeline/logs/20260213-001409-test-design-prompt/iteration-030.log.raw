Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error.

Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site.

WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs.

Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"tool_use_id":"toolu_01At9ss5uEU3jgBq14SwKQkw","type":"tool_result","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Now I have comprehensive information. Let me create a detailed summary document:\n\n## Comprehensive Investigation Report: Issue #363 - Wrapper/Adapter Functions for scoringutils\n\nBased on my thorough investigation of the scoringutils codebase, here is the detailed analysis needed to design test specifications for adapter functions like `wrap_binary_numeric()` and `wrap_switch_order()`.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **How Metrics Are Called by `apply_metrics()`**\n\n**Key File:** `R/score.R` (lines 152-163)\n\nThe `apply_metrics()` function applies a list of metric functions to forecast data:\n\n```r\napply_metrics <- function(forecast, metrics, ...) {\n  lapply(names(metrics), function(metric_name) {\n    result <- do.call(\n      run_safely,\n      list(..., fun = metrics[[metric_name]], metric_name = metric_name)\n    )\n    if (!is.null(result)) {\n      forecast[, (metric_name) := result]\n    }\n  })\n  return(forecast)\n}\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- `apply_metrics()` passes all `...` arguments plus the metric function to `run_safely()`\n- `run_safely()` (lines 193-224) handles filtering arguments to only those the function accepts\n- It uses `formals(fun)` to inspect function parameters and filters out named arguments that aren't in the function signature\n- **Unnamed arguments are always passed through** (this is how the metric receives the actual data)\n- **Named arguments not in the function signature are silently dropped**\n\n**How Metrics Receive Data:**\n- For `score.forecast_binary()` (line 113): `apply_metrics(forecast, metrics, forecast$observed, forecast$predicted)`\n  - Calls each metric as: `metric_func(forecast$observed, forecast$predicted, ...)`\n  - Both arguments are **unnamed**, so they're always passed\n  \n- For `score.forecast_sample()` (line 145-148): `apply_metrics(forecast, metrics, observed, predicted)`\n  - After reshaping: `observed` is a vector, `predicted` is a matrix\n  - Called as: `metric_func(observed, predicted, ...)`\n\n- For `score.forecast_quantile()` (line 156-159): `apply_metrics(df, metrics, observed, predicted, quantile_level)`\n  - Passes **three unnamed arguments**\n  - Metrics receive: `metric_func(observed, predicted, quantile_level, ...)`\n\n**Key Implication for Adapters:** Adapters wrap metric functions and must maintain this signature pattern—they receive the data as unnamed positional arguments and must handle them correctly.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **How `get_metrics()` Works -

Let me create a detailed summary document:\n\n## Comprehensive Investigation Report: Issue #363 - Wrapper/Adapter Functions for scoringutils\n\nBased on my thorough investigation of the scoringutils codebase, here is the detailed analysis needed to design test specifications for adapter functions like `wrap_binary_numeric()` and `wrap_switch_order()`.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **How Metrics Are Called by `apply_metrics()`**\n\n**Key File:** `R/score.R` (lines 152-163)\n\nThe `apply_metrics()` function applies a list of metric functions to forecast data:\n\n```r\napply_metrics <- function(forecast, metrics, ...) {\n  lapply(names(metrics), function(metric_name) {\n    result <- do.call(\n      run_safely,\n      list(..., fun = metrics[[metric_name]], metric_name = metric_name)\n    )\n    if (!is.null(result)) {\n      forecast[, (metric_name) := result]\n    }\n  })\n  return(forecast)\n}\n```\n\n**Critical Details:**\n- `apply_metrics()` passes all `...` arguments plus the metric function to `run_safely()`\n- `run_safely()` (lines 193-224) handles filtering arguments to only those the function accepts\n- It uses `formals(fun)` to inspect function parameters and filters out named arguments that aren't in the function signature\n- **Unnamed arguments are always passed through** (this is how the metric receives the actual data)\n- **Named arguments not in the function signature are silently dropped**\n\n**How Metrics Receive Data:**\n- For `score.forecast_binary()` (line 113): `apply_metrics(forecast, metrics, forecast$observed, forecast$predicted)`\n  - Calls each metric as: `metric_func(forecast$observed, forecast$predicted, ...)`\n  - Both arguments are **unnamed**, so they're always passed\n  \n- For `score.forecast_sample()` (line 145-148): `apply_metrics(forecast, metrics, observed, predicted)`\n  - After reshaping: `observed` is a vector, `predicted` is a matrix\n  - Called as: `metric_func(observed, predicted, ...)`\n\n- For `score.forecast_quantile()` (line 156-159): `apply_metrics(df, metrics, observed, predicted, quantile_level)`\n  - Passes **three unnamed arguments**\n  - Metrics receive: `metric_func(observed, predicted, quantile_level, ...)`\n\n**Key Implication for Adapters:** Adapters wrap metric functions and must maintain this signature pattern—they receive the data as unnamed positional arguments and must handle them correctly.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **How `get_metrics()` Works -

1\n  brierscore <- (observed - predicted)^2\n  return(brierscore)\n}\n```\n\n**Key Detail:** The function internally converts factor to numeric with `as.numeric(observed) - 1`, expecting levels [0, 1].\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Sample Forecast Specifics**\n\n**Format Definition** (`R/class-forecast-sample.R`, lines 4-12):\n```\n- observed: numeric vector with observed values\n- predicted: numeric with predicted values (random samples)\n- sample_id: unique identifiers for each sample\n```\n\n**Metric Calling** (`R/class-forecast-sample.R`, lines 145-148):\n```r\nobserved <- forecast$observed\npredicted <- do.call(rbind, forecast$predicted)\nforecast[, c(\"observed\", \"predicted\", \".scoringutils_N\") := NULL]\n\nforecast <- apply_metrics(\n  forecast, metrics,\n  observed, predicted\n)\n```\n\n**Key Detail:** Predictions are reshaped into an **n x N matrix** where n = number of observations and N = number of samples.\n\n**Available Metrics** (`R/class-forecast-sample.R`, lines 179-190):\n- `bias` — bias_sample()\n- `dss` — dss_sample()\n- `crps` — crps_sample()\n- `overprediction` — overprediction_sample()\n- `underprediction` — underprediction_sample()\n- `dispersion` — dispersion_sample()\n- `log_score` — logs_sample()\n- `mad` — mad_sample()\n- `ae_median` — ae_median_sample()\n- `se_mean` — se_mean_sample()\n\n**Example Metric Input** (`R/metrics-sample.R`, lines 98-123):\n```r\nbias_sample <- function(observed, predicted) {\n  assert_input_sample(observed, predicted)\n  prediction_type <- get_type(predicted)\n  \n  # Expected inputs:\n  # observed: vector of length n\n  # predicted: n x N matrix\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Existing Helpers and Test Fixtures**\n\n**Setup Fixtures** (from `tests/testthat/setup.R`):\n- `example_quantile`, `example_sample_continuous`, `example_sample_discrete`, `example_point`, `example_binary`, `example_nominal` — pre-loaded example datasets\n- `scores_quantile`, `scores_sample_continuous`, `scores_sample_discrete`, `scores_point`, `scores_binary`, `scores_nominal` — pre-computed scores\n\n**Helper Test Functions** Used throughout tests:\n- `expect_no_condition()` — tests that code runs without errors/warnings\n- `expect_error()` — tests that code raises expected errors\n- `expect_warning()` — tests that code produces expected warnings\n- `expect_equal()` / `expect_identical()` — comparison tests\n- `as_forecast_binary()`, `as_forecast_sample()`, `as_forecast_quantile()`, `as_forecast_point()` — create forecast objects\n- `score()` — compute scores\n- `get_metrics()` — retrieve available metrics\n- `select_metrics()` — filter metrics by name\n\n---\n\n## Summary: What Adapters Need to Handle\n\nFor `wrap_binary_numeric()` and `wrap_switch_order()` to work correctly:\n\n### `wrap_binary_numeric(func)`\n**Purpose:** Convert factor observed values to numeric 0/1 before passing to external function\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n1. Must accept a metric function as input\n2. Must return a function with signature: `function(observed, predicted, ...)`\n3. Must convert `observed` from factor to numeric (subtracting 1)\n4. Must pass the converted values to the original function\n5. Must preserve `...` arguments so `run_safely()` can filter them\n6. The result should be a function object (compatible with `purrr::partial()`)\n\n**Usage Pattern:**\n```r\nexternal_metric <- function(y, X) { ... }  # expects numeric y\nwrapped_metric <- wrap_binary_numeric(external_metric)\nmetrics <- list(custom = wrapped_metric)\nscore(forecast, metrics = metrics)\n```\n\n### `wrap_switch_order(func)`\n**Purpose:** Swap observed/predicted argument order for external functions with different signatures\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n1. Must accept a metric function as input\n2. Must return a function with the standard signature: `function(observed, predicted, ...)`\n3. Must call the original function with arguments swapped: `func(predicted, observed, ...)`\n4. Must preserve `...` arguments\n\n**Usage Pattern:**\n```r\nexternal_metric <- function(X, y) { ... }  # expects X first, then y\nwrapped_metric <- wrap_switch_order(external_metric)\nmetrics <- list(custom = wrapped_metric)\nscore(forecast, metrics = metrics)\n```\n\nBoth adapters should be testable with:\n- Direct function calls outside of `score()` context\n- Usage within `score()` with binary, sample, quantile, and point forecasts\n- Combination with `purrr::partial()` for further customization\n- Error handling for invalid inputs"}],"totalDurationMs":80588,"totalTokens":65578,"totalToolUseCount":35,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2263,"cache_read_input_tokens":58992,"output_tokens":4323,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2263,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[]}}}

Document usage in `score()`'s \"Customising metrics\" section. Resolve naming convention with maintainers first.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant. No wrapper/adapter functions exist. Users must manually wrap external metrics with non-standard signatures (e.g., reversed arg order, numeric 0/1 instead of factor observed). Two small wrapper proposals in the issue body (`wrap_binary_numeric`, `wrap_switch_order`) were never implemented. The `purrr::partial()` mechanism alone cannot solve argument reordering or type conversion. Zero comments, no design consensus. 2+ years old.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-metric-adapters.R` (new)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat with data.table fixtures; `example_binary`/`example_sample_continuous`/`example_point` datasets used directly; custom metrics passed as named lists to `score()`; `purrr::partial()` pattern used for metric customization (see `test-metrics.R:89`); `run_safely()` filters named args via `formals()` introspection; metrics called with unnamed positional args (observed, predicted, ...) via `apply_metrics()`.\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"metric_adapt_binary_numeric() converts factor observed to numeric 0/1\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core use case — external binary metrics expecting numeric 0/1 fail when given factor observed values\n**Setup**:\n- Create factor observed: `observed <- factor(c(0, 1, 1, 0, 1))`\n- Create predicted probabilities: `predicted <- c(0.2, 0.8, 0.6, 0.3, 0.9)`\n- Define a simple external metric that requires numeric observed: `external_brier <- function(observed, predicted) { (observed - predicted)^2 }` (this would fail with factor input because arithmetic on factors is not supported)\n**Action**:\n- Call `adapted <- metric_adapt_binary_numeric(external_brier)`\n- Call `result <- adapted(observed, predicted)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_equal(result, (c(0, 1, 1, 0, 1) - predicted)^2)` — the factor is converted to 0/1 numeric and the external function computes correctly\n- Without the adapter, `external_brier(observed, predicted)` should produce an error or `NA` values because factor arithmetic is not meaningful\n**Fails now because**:\n- `metric_adapt_binary_numeric()` does not exist. There is no adapter mechanism to convert factor observed to numeric for external metrics.\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"metric_adapt_binary_numeric() works inside score() with binary forecasts\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: end-to-end integration of the adapter within the `score()` pipeline\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_binary` dataset\n- Define an external metric expecting numeric 0/1: `numeric_brier <- function(observed, predicted) { (observed - predicted)^2 }`\n- Wrap it: `adapted_brier <- metric_adapt_binary_numeric(numeric_brier)`\n- Build custom metrics list: `metrics <- list(custom_brier = adapted_brier)`\n**Action**:\n- Call `result <- score(example_binary, metrics = metrics)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_s3_class(result, \"scores\")` — scoring completes without error\n- `expect_true(\"custom_brier\" %in% names(result))` — custom metric column is present\n- The custom_brier values should match `brier_score()` output (since both compute squared error after factor-to-numeric conversion): compare against `score(example_binary, metrics = list(brier_score = brier_score))$brier_score`\n**Fails now because**:\n- `metric_adapt_binary_numeric()` does not exist, so there is no way to use a numeric-expecting external metric within `score()` for binary forecasts.\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"metric_adapt_swap_args() reverses observed/predicted argument order\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core use case — external metrics with `function(predicted, observed)` signature fail when called as `function(observed, predicted)`\n**Setup**:\n- Create numeric data: `observed <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`, `predicted <- c(1.1, 2.2, 2.8, 4.1, 5.3)`\n- Define an external metric with swapped arg order that records what it receives: `swapped_ae <- function(predicted, observed) { abs(predicted - observed) }` (this function expects predicted first, observed second)\n- Also define a reference function: `normal_ae <- function(observed, predicted) { abs(observed - predicted) }`\n**Action**:\n- Call `adapted <- metric_adapt_swap_args(swapped_ae)`\n- Call `result <- adapted(observed, predicted)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_equal(result, normal_ae(observed, predicted))` — both produce the same absolute errors\n- Verify the swap actually happened: define a function that returns its first arg: `first_arg <- function(a, b) { a }`. Then `metric_adapt_swap_args(first_arg)(10, 20)` should return `20` (not `10`), because the adapter swaps the positional args before calling the inner function.\n**Fails now because**:\n- `metric_adapt_swap_args()` does not exist.

Document usage in `score()`'s \"Customising metrics\" section. Resolve naming convention with maintainers first.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant. No wrapper/adapter functions exist. Users must manually wrap external metrics with non-standard signatures (e.g., reversed arg order, numeric 0/1 instead of factor observed). Two small wrapper proposals in the issue body (`wrap_binary_numeric`, `wrap_switch_order`) were never implemented. The `purrr::partial()` mechanism alone cannot solve argument reordering or type conversion. Zero comments, no design consensus. 2+ years old.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-metric-adapters.R` (new)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat with data.table fixtures; `example_binary`/`example_sample_continuous`/`example_point` datasets used directly; custom metrics passed as named lists to `score()`; `purrr::partial()` pattern used for metric customization (see `test-metrics.R:89`); `run_safely()` filters named args via `formals()` introspection; metrics called with unnamed positional args (observed, predicted, ...) via `apply_metrics()`.\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"metric_adapt_binary_numeric() converts factor observed to numeric 0/1\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core use case — external binary metrics expecting numeric 0/1 fail when given factor observed values\n**Setup**:\n- Create factor observed: `observed <- factor(c(0, 1, 1, 0, 1))`\n- Create predicted probabilities: `predicted <- c(0.2, 0.8, 0.6, 0.3, 0.9)`\n- Define a simple external metric that requires numeric observed: `external_brier <- function(observed, predicted) { (observed - predicted)^2 }` (this would fail with factor input because arithmetic on factors is not supported)\n**Action**:\n- Call `adapted <- metric_adapt_binary_numeric(external_brier)`\n- Call `result <- adapted(observed, predicted)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_equal(result, (c(0, 1, 1, 0, 1) - predicted)^2)` — the factor is converted to 0/1 numeric and the external function computes correctly\n- Without the adapter, `external_brier(observed, predicted)` should produce an error or `NA` values because factor arithmetic is not meaningful\n**Fails now because**:\n- `metric_adapt_binary_numeric()` does not exist. There is no adapter mechanism to convert factor observed to numeric for external metrics.\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"metric_adapt_binary_numeric() works inside score() with binary forecasts\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: end-to-end integration of the adapter within the `score()` pipeline\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_binary` dataset\n- Define an external metric expecting numeric 0/1: `numeric_brier <- function(observed, predicted) { (observed - predicted)^2 }`\n- Wrap it: `adapted_brier <- metric_adapt_binary_numeric(numeric_brier)`\n- Build custom metrics list: `metrics <- list(custom_brier = adapted_brier)`\n**Action**:\n- Call `result <- score(example_binary, metrics = metrics)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_s3_class(result, \"scores\")` — scoring completes without error\n- `expect_true(\"custom_brier\" %in% names(result))` — custom metric column is present\n- The custom_brier values should match `brier_score()` output (since both compute squared error after factor-to-numeric conversion): compare against `score(example_binary, metrics = list(brier_score = brier_score))$brier_score`\n**Fails now because**:\n- `metric_adapt_binary_numeric()` does not exist, so there is no way to use a numeric-expecting external metric within `score()` for binary forecasts.\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"metric_adapt_swap_args() reverses observed/predicted argument order\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core use case — external metrics with `function(predicted, observed)` signature fail when called as `function(observed, predicted)`\n**Setup**:\n- Create numeric data: `observed <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`, `predicted <- c(1.1, 2.2, 2.8, 4.1, 5.3)`\n- Define an external metric with swapped arg order that records what it receives: `swapped_ae <- function(predicted, observed) { abs(predicted - observed) }` (this function expects predicted first, observed second)\n- Also define a reference function: `normal_ae <- function(observed, predicted) { abs(observed - predicted) }`\n**Action**:\n- Call `adapted <- metric_adapt_swap_args(swapped_ae)`\n- Call `result <- adapted(observed, predicted)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_equal(result, normal_ae(observed, predicted))` — both produce the same absolute errors\n- Verify the swap actually happened: define a function that returns its first arg: `first_arg <- function(a, b) { a }`. Then `metric_adapt_swap_args(first_arg)(10, 20)` should return `20` (not `10`), because the adapter swaps the positional args before calling the inner function.\n**Fails now because**:\n- `metric_adapt_swap_args()` does not exist. Users must manually write wrapper functions or use `purrr::partial()` (which cannot reorder positional arguments).\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"metric_adapt_swap_args() works inside score() with point forecasts\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: end-to-end integration of the swap adapter within `score()` for point forecasts\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_point` dataset\n- Define an external absolute error function with swapped order: `swapped_ae <- function(predicted, observed) { abs(predicted - observed) }`\n- Wrap it: `adapted_ae <- metric_adapt_swap_args(swapped_ae)`\n- Build metrics list: `metrics <- list(ae_adapted = adapted_ae)`\n**Action**:\n- Call `result <- score(example_point, metrics = metrics)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_s3_class(result, \"scores\")` — scoring completes without error\n- `expect_true(\"ae_adapted\" %in% names(result))` — custom metric column is present\n- Values should match the standard absolute error: compare `result$ae_adapted` against `score(example_point, metrics = list(ae_point = Metrics::ae))$ae_point`\n**Fails now because**:\n- `metric_adapt_swap_args()` does not exist.\n\n### Test 5: test_that(\"metric_adapt_swap_args() works inside score() with sample forecasts\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: integration with sample forecasts where predicted is a matrix (not a vector)\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_sample_continuous` dataset\n- Define an external CRPS-like function with swapped order: `swapped_crps <- function(predicted, observed) { scoringRules::crps_sample(y = observed, dat = predicted) }` (note: `scoringRules::crps_sample` already takes `(y, dat)` which is `(observed, predicted)` order)\n- Actually, a simpler approach: define `swapped_mad <- function(predicted, observed) { apply(predicted, 1, mad) }` which ignores observed but takes predicted first\n- Wrap it: `adapted_mad <- metric_adapt_swap_args(swapped_mad)`\n- Build metrics list: `metrics <- list(mad_adapted = adapted_mad)`\n**Action**:\n- Call `result <- score(example_sample_continuous, metrics = metrics)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_s3_class(result, \"scores\")` — scoring completes without error\n- `expect_true(\"mad_adapted\" %in% names(result))` — custom metric column is present\n- Values should match the standard `mad_sample()` output: compare `result$mad_adapted` against `score(example_sample_continuous, metrics = list(mad = mad_sample))$mad`\n**Fails now because**:\n- `metric_adapt_swap_args()` does not exist.\n\n### Test 6: test_that(\"adapted metrics return a function object\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: adapters must return proper function objects that are compatible with `validate_metrics()`, `run_safely()`, and `purrr::partial()`\n**Setup**:\n- Define a dummy metric: `dummy <- function(observed, predicted) { 0 }`\n**Action**:\n- Call `adapted_numeric <- metric_adapt_binary_numeric(dummy)`\n- Call `adapted_swap <- metric_adapt_swap_args(dummy)`\n**Expected**:\n- `checkmate::expect_class(adapted_numeric, \"function\")` — the result is a function\n- `checkmate::expect_class(adapted_swap, \"function\")` — the result is a function\n- `expect_true(length(formals(adapted_numeric)) >= 2)` — the function has at least `observed` and `predicted` formals (important for `run_safely()` arg filtering)\n- `expect_true(\"...\" %in% names(formals(adapted_numeric)))` — the function accepts `...` so `run_safely()` passes through all args\n- Same checks for `adapted_swap`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Neither adapter function exists.\n\n### Test 7: test_that(\"adapted metrics compose with purrr::partial()\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: adapters should be composable with the existing `purrr::partial()` customization pattern\n**Setup**:\n- Define a metric with an extra parameter: `weighted_brier <- function(observed, predicted, weight = 1) { weight * (observed -

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature). If yes, run `usethis::use_release_issue()` and proceed with CRAN submission. If not, close the issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1064 | Pre-ranking for multivariate calibration assessment | | 2026-01-30 | feature | medium | large | no | No pre-ranking or multivariate calibration diagnostics exist in the codebase. The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site.

WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #759 (vignette future). | Decide whether to integrate `illustration-effect-scale.png` into `scoring-rules.Rmd` or a new \"Choosing a score\" vignette, with text explaining how average scores scale with forecast target magnitude. If unwanted, close and delete orphaned PNG. Address with #929/#933/#934 as batch. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 929 | Use nice illustration of Sharpness and calibration | documentation | 2024-09-27 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. Unlike siblings (#930, #933, #934), the calibration/sharpness PNG does **not** exist in the repo — it was never generated. Code to create it is in the issue body. The `scoring-rules.Rmd` has a commented-out calibration section (lines ~449-492) where this illustration would naturally fit. | Sibling issues #930, #933, #934. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #759 (vignette future), #785 (vignette updates). | Generate `calibration-sharpness-illustration.png` from the code in the issue body, place in `vignettes/`, and integrate into `scoring-rules.Rmd` (or a new \"Choosing a score\" vignette). Coordinate with #930/#933/#934 batch. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 927 | Make all internal columns, in particular `forecast_id`, more robust by prefixing it with \"scoringutils_\" | good first issue, high-priority | 2024-09-26 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. Unprefixed internal columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) risk collision with user data columns. Codebase already mixes two conventions: `.scoringutils_*` (e.g., `.scoringutils_N`) and `scoringutils_Internal*`. ~3 source files, 1 globalVariables file, 1 snapshot to update for `forecast_id` alone. Not a breaking change — all affected columns are internal. | None blocking. Self-contained refactor. | Rename unprefixed internal temp columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) to `.scoringutils_` prefix, matching existing convention. Update `R/helper-quantile-interval-range.R`, `R/metrics-quantile.R`, `R/z-globalVariables.R`, and test snapshots. Also unify the two naming conventions (`.scoringutils_*` vs `scoringutils_Internal*`). | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 922 | remove `check_columns_present` | | 2024-09-25 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `check_columns_present` (and `test_columns_present`) are internal functions with 10 call sites across 9 files. All can be replaced by `checkmate::assert_subset`/`check_subset`/`test_subset` (already a dependency). One call site in `pairwise-comparisons.R:143` uses a custom error message and needs slightly different handling. No user-facing API impact. | Related to #839 (remove `test_columns_not_present`) — both modify `R/check-input-helpers.R`, should be batched. | Replace all 10 call sites of `check_columns_present` (and 1 of `test_columns_present`) with equivalent `checkmate` functions, then delete both functions and their tests. Consider batching with #839. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 909 | Compact version of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` | enhancement, good first issue, help wanted | 2024-09-13 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Already implemented. The `counts` parameter on `get_duplicate_forecasts()` provides exactly the compact output requested. Tests exist. Issue can be closed. | None | Close this issue — the `counts` argument already provides compact/aggregated duplicate output. No further code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 907 | coverage of function factory | enhancement | 2024-09-12 | enhancement | low | small | partially | Still relevant. No factory helper exists. Users must manually use `purrr::partial()` (documented in `score()` docs). Only `interval_coverage` benefits currently. Hard-coded 50% and 90% variants in `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()`. Discussion stalled after 5 comments with no consensus on approach. | Related to #451 (quantile/interval metric organization), #668 (coverage flexibility). | Add either a generic `expand_metric()` utility or a `coverage_ranges` argument to `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()` to programmatically generate multiple parameterized coverage metric variants. Needs design decision on approach given only one metric currently benefits. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 898 | Support for \"Mixture of Parameters\" scoring | feature request | 2024-09-06 | feature | low | large | partially | Still relevant but low urgency. No `forecast_distribution` class exists. Prerequisites #832 (metrics S3 rework) and #846 (ordinal class) are done. Original requester has deprioritized. Would require new class, input format design, dispatch to `scoringRules` parametric functions, and mixture handling. | #888 (S3 rework of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` — minor blocker for clean extensibility). Builds on completed #832, #846. | Implement a new `forecast_distribution` class for scoring forecasts expressed as parametric distributions or mixtures, dispatching to `scoringRules`' closed-form scoring functions. Deferred until active demand — keep on `scoringutils-2.x` milestone. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 895 | Check quantile prediction order helper function | enhancement | 2024-08-19 | enhancement | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. Monotonicity check only exists deep in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (metrics-quantile.R:495) as a hard error. No early warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. No user-facing diagnostic function. Issue #412 is the maintainer-created parent with an agreed plan (steps 1 and 3 not done). | Duplicate of / should be resolved together with #412. | Create a user-facing helper (e.g., `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`) to identify rows where predictions decrease with increasing quantile level, and add a warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. Resolves both #895 and #412. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 889 | Make `get_protected_columns()` S3 to avoid hard-coding things | high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_protected_columns()` is a plain function with a hard-coded superset of all column names for all forecast types. Not S3. Only 2 call sites (both in `forecast-unit.R`). The `intersect()` filter masks the problem but prevents extensibility for new forecast classes. No progress made. | Coordinate with #888 (same S3 pattern for `get_duplicate_forecasts()`). Unblocks #852 (new forecast class workflow). Largely resolves #740 (`get_forecast_unit` customization). | Convert `get_protected_columns()` into an S3 generic with per-class methods so each forecast type declares its own protected columns. Coordinate with #888 for consistent pattern. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 888 | Rework `get_duplicate_forecasts()` to S3 to avoid hard-coding columns and types | high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. Function hard-codes `c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\", \"predicted_label\")` in two places instead of dispatching on S3 class. No work done. Codebase has many S3 precedents now. | Coordinate with #889 (same pattern for `get_protected_columns()`). Partially blocks #898, #852. Related to #740. | Convert `get_duplicate_forecasts()` into an S3 generic with per-class methods where each method knows its own type-specific columns. Retain a `.data.frame`/`.default` method with current column-sniffing logic for backward compatibility. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 885 | Functions to export or make internal | refactor, high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Partially done. `validate_forecast()` already deleted (PR #921). Remaining: `as_forecast_generic()`, `as_scores()`, `apply_metrics()` still internal; `new_forecast()` ambiguously exported with `@keywords internal`. Design decision needed on which functions to export for custom forecast class authors. | Depends on #746 (closed). Blocks custom forecast class creation. Related to #852 (design workflow for new classes). | Decide final export list for custom forecast class API: export `as_forecast_generic()`, `as_scores()`, `apply_metrics()`, resolve ambiguous `new_forecast()` status, and update NAMESPACE.

No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy.

Both are trivial to add following the `mad_sample()` pattern (data-independent, apply function row-wise over predicted matrix). `dispersion_sample()` (CRPS component) also measures spread but is observation-dependent. `scoringRules` provides no additional sharpness measures. | None. Self-contained addition following existing `mad_sample()` pattern. | Implement `sd_sample()` and `iqr_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R` following the `mad_sample()` pattern.

True Talagrand/verification rank histogram also not implemented as a distinct tool. Maintainer said \"no active plan, but nice to have.\" 5+ years old. | Thematically overlaps with #286 (advanced calibration diagnostics).

Open since 2020 with maintainer agreement but explicitly deferred. | Dependency of #1055 (model confidence sets). Related to #750 (p-value refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #1022 (two-model case). | Add `\"dm\"` as a new `test_type` option in `compare_forecasts()`.
