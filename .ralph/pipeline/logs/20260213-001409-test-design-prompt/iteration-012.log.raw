Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output. Update test snapshots. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    31→| 1026 | as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile | enhancement | 2025-07-13 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    33→| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    34→| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    42→| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name.

All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`).

No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy.

NEWS.md documents: \"Removed `interval_coverage_sample()` as users are now expected to convert to a quantile format first before scoring.\" Coverage is now handled by `interval_coverage()` (quantile-based) and `get_coverage()`. Issue can be closed. | None. | Close this issue — `interval_coverage_sample()` was intentionally removed in v2.0.0. The underlying concerns (code simplification, reuse of `interval_coverage_quantile`) were resolved by deleting the function and unifying the API around quantile-format coverage computation. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 406 | Maybe expose `get_type()`. | | 2023-11-10 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `get_type()` (vector type detection: classification/integer/continuous) and `get_forecast_type()` (forecast class type) both exist in `R/get-forecast-type.R` but are internal (`@keywords internal`), not exported.

No conversion functions for external packages (Stan, Odin, yardstick, hubverse) exist. The `as_forecast_*` S3 generic system provides extension points for external packages to write their own methods. Hubverse integration was explicitly moved to external `hubEvals` package (#605 closed). Maintainer consensus: package-specific conversions are too varied and dependency-heavy for scoringutils. Yardstick conversion code in comments never formalized. 2+ years old with no progress. | Related to #356 (interoperability vignette), #363 (external function interface), #852 (custom forecast class workflow), #983 (`.data.frame` methods), #1026 (`as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile`). | Consider narrowing scope or closing in favor of more specific issues. The broad goal is better served by: (1) completing S3 extensibility infrastructure (#852, #983, #889, #888), (2) writing an interoperability vignette (#356), and (3) possibly adding 1-2 zero-dependency convenience converters if demand warrants.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite. A commented-out test skeleton exists in `test-score.R` (lines 51-62). `apply_metrics()` silently overwrites any existing column whose name matches a metric name via `forecast[, (metric_name) := result]`.

No wrapper/adapter functions exist. Users must manually wrap external metrics with non-standard signatures (e.g., reversed arg order, numeric 0/1 instead of factor observed). Two small wrapper proposals in the issue body (`wrap_binary_numeric`, `wrap_switch_order`) were never implemented. The `purrr::partial()` mechanism alone cannot solve argument reordering or type conversion. Zero comments, no design consensus. 2+ years old. | Related to #362 (non-standard I/O formats), #522 (test user-provided scoring functions), #385 (data transformation), #789 (customization docs). No blockers. | Implement 2-3 small exported adapter functions (e.g., `metric_adapt_binary_numeric()` to convert factor to 0/1, `metric_adapt_swap_args()` to reverse observed/predicted order).

Metrics with non-standard I/O (many-to-one like AUC, many-to-many like PIT) cannot fit into `score()`. The PIT case is solved outside `score()` via `get_pit_histogram()`. Zero comments, no design consensus. The multivariate sample class introduced a partial precedent (multiple rows collapse into groups) but by restructuring data before `apply_metrics()`, not by changing it. 2+ years old. | Related to #455 (data frame returns — recommended for closure), #363 (wrapper functions), #338 (cross-type metrics), #941 (rethink `score()` S3), #852 (custom class workflow). | Long-term design question with no clear path forward. The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established. Consider closing as won't-fix or consolidating with #455, #363, #338 into a single milestone-level tracking issue.

Consensus reached on MVP: add a warning when `get_type(predicted) == \"integer\"`. Discussion also suggested possibly removing `log_score` from default metrics for sample forecasts. | None. All building blocks exist (`get_type()`, `cli_warn()`, pattern established in `bias_sample()`). | Add `get_type(predicted)` check to `logs_sample()` that emits `cli_warn()` when predictions are integer-valued. Optionally move `log_score` out of the default metric list in `get_metrics.forecast_sample()`.

The remaining question is whether individual metric functions (e.g., `bias_sample`/`bias_quantile`) should also become S3 generics for standalone use. Practical need is low since `score()` already dispatches correctly via `get_metrics.<class>`. 6 conceptual metrics span 2+ forecast types with type-suffixed names. | #832 (done). Related to #455 (vector returns), #941 (rethink `score()` S3). No blockers. | Consider downgrading from \"Breaking change\" since S3 wrappers could be additive. If pursued, create `bias()`, `overprediction()`, `underprediction()`, `dispersion()`, `ae_median()`, `logs()` as S3 generics dispatching on forecast class, keeping suffixed functions as implementations.

Other functions in the same file (e.g., `bias_sample`, `pit_histogram_sample`) already have formula-rich roxygen documentation via `\\deqn{}`, providing a clear template. `dss_sample()` is worst — almost no description beyond \"wrapper.\" | None. Standalone documentation task. | Add `\\deqn{}` mathematical formulas and expanded descriptions to roxygen docs of `crps_sample()`, `logs_sample()`, and `dss_sample()` in `R/metrics-sample.R`.

(2) Optionally evaluate adding `matrixStats` for 3 `apply()` calls — lower value, separate decision.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant. Neither recommendation acted upon. `Metrics` package still imported for 3 trivial functions (`ae`, `se`, `ape`) used only in `R/class-forecast-point.R`."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":381,"cache_read_input_tokens":52039,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":381},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a6c236b1-3281-41ca-b12f-868322653287","uuid":"bbe321b6-134f-4d1c-9f9e-88c6a9be8786"}

You can, of course, also use your own scoring rules, provided they follow the same format. If you want to obtain more detailed information about how the package works, have a look at the [revised version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1URaMsXmHJ1twpLpMl1sl2HW4lPuUycoj/view?usp=drive_link) of our `scoringutils` paper.\n    27→\n    28→We can distinguish two types of forecasts: point forecasts and probabilistic forecasts. A point forecast is a single number representing a single outcome. A probabilistic forecast is a full predictive probability distribution over multiple possible outcomes. In contrast to point forecasts, probabilistic forecasts incorporate uncertainty about different possible outcomes.\n    29→\n    30→Scoring rules are functions that take a forecast and an observation as input and return a single numeric value. For point forecasts, they take the form $S(\\hat{y}, y)$, where $\\hat{y}$ is the forecast and $y$ is the observation. For probabilistic forecasts, they usually take the form $S(F, y)$, where $F$ is the cumulative density function (CDF) of the predictive distribution and $y$ is the observation. By convention, scoring rules are usually negatively oriented, meaning that smaller values are better (the best possible score is usually zero). In that sense, the score can be understood as a penalty.\n    31→\n    32→Many scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts are so-called (strictly) proper scoring rules. Essentially, this means that they cannot be \"cheated\": A forecaster evaluated by a strictly proper scoring rule is always incentivised to report her honest best belief about the future and cannot, in expectation, improve her score by reporting something else. A more formal definition is the following: Let $G$ be the true, unobserved data-generating distribution. A scoring rule is said to be proper, if under $G$ and for an ideal forecast $F = G$, there is no forecast $F' \\neq F$ that in expectation receives a better score than $F$. A scoring rule is considered strictly proper if, under $G$, no other forecast $F'$ in expectation receives a score that is better than or the same as that of $F$.\n    33→\n    34→---\n    35→\n    36→# Metrics for point forecasts\n    37→\n    38→See a list of the default metrics for point forecasts by calling `get_metrics(example_point)`.\n    39→\n    40→This is an overview of the input and output formats for point forecasts:\n    41→\n    42→```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=\"100%\", fig.cap=\"Input and output formats: metrics for point.\"}\n    43→knitr::include_graphics(file.path(\"scoring-rules\", \"input-point.png\"))\n    44→```\n    45→\n    46→\n    47→## A note of caution\n    48→\n    49→Scoring point forecasts can be tricky business. Depending on the choice of the scoring rule, a forecaster who is clearly worse than another, might consistently receive better scores (see @gneitingMakingEvaluatingPoint2011 for an illustrative example).\n    50→\n    51→Every scoring rule for a point forecast is implicitly minimised by a specific aspect of the predictive distribution. The mean squared error, for example, is only a meaningful scoring rule if the forecaster actually reported the mean of their predictive distribution as a point forecast. If the forecaster reported the median, then the mean absolute error would be the appropriate scoring rule. If the scoring rule and the predictive task do not align, misleading results ensue. Consider the following example:\n    52→\n    53→```{r}\n    54→set.seed(123)\n    55→n <- 1000\n    56→observed <- rnorm(n, 5, 4)^2\n    57→\n    58→predicted_mu <- mean(observed)\n    59→predicted_not_mu <- predicted_mu - rnorm(n, 10, 2)\n    60→\n    61→mean(Metrics::ae(observed, predicted_mu))\n    62→mean(Metrics::ae(observed, predicted_not_mu))\n    63→\n    64→mean(Metrics::se(observed, predicted_mu))\n    65→mean(Metrics::se(observed, predicted_not_mu))\n    66→```\n    67→\n    68→\n    69→\n    70→## Absolute error\n    71→\n    72→**Observation**: $y$, a real number\n    73→\n    74→**Forecast**: $\\hat{y}$, a real number, the median of the forecaster's predictive distribution.\n    75→\n    76→The absolute error is the absolute difference between the predicted and the observed values.

It can also be understood as the integral over the Brier score for the binary probability forecasts implied by the CDF for all possible observed values. The CRPS is also related to the Cramér-distance between two distributions and equals the special case where one of the distributions is concentrated in a single point (see e.g. @zielEnergyDistanceEnsemble2021). The CRPS is a global scoring rule, meaning that the entire predictive distribution is taken into account when determining the quality of the forecast.\n   206→\n   207→`scoringutils` re-exports the `crps_sample()` function from the `scoringRules` package, which assumes that the forecast is represented by a set of samples from the predictive distribution.

It is therefore considered to be sensitive to outlier forecasts. This may be desirable in some applications, but it also means that scores can easily be dominated by a few extreme values. The logarithmic scoring rule is a local scoring rule, meaning that the score only depends on the probability that was assigned to the actual outcome. This is often regarded as a desirable property for example in the context of Bayesian inference \\citep{winklerScoringRulesEvaluation1996}. It implies for example, that the ranking between forecasters would be invariant under monotone transformations of the predictive distribution and the target.\n   250→\n   251→`scoringutils` re-exports the `logs_sample()` function from the `scoringRules` package, which assumes that the forecast is represented by a set of samples from the predictive distribution. One implications of this is that it is currently not advisable to use the log score for discrete forecasts. The reason for this is that `scoringRules::logs_sample()` estimates a predictive density from the samples, which can be problematic for discrete forecasts.\n   252→\n   253→See `?logs_sample()` for more information.\n   254→\n   255→\n   256→## Dawid-Sebastiani score\n   257→\n   258→**Observation**: $y$, a real number (or a discrete number).\n   259→\n   260→**Forecast**: $F$.

OPTIONAL CONSIDERATION: matrixStats\n\n**Result:** No uses of `apply()` calls found that would benefit from `matrixStats`. The main scoring uses `apply_metrics()` which is a custom wrapper function.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES NEEDED FOR ISSUE #825\n\n**Files to modify:**\n\n1. **`R/class-forecast-point.R`** - Create internal one-liner functions to replace Metrics functions\n2. **`DESCRIPTION`** - Remove `Metrics` from Imports (line 62)\n3. **`NAMESPACE`** - Remove three `importFrom(Metrics,*)` lines (lines 112-114)\n4. **`vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd`** - Update documentation examples (optional: use internal functions instead)\n\n**No changes needed:**\n- Test files (tests work through the `score()` function, not directly with Metrics)\n- No matrixStats usage found (optional evaluation as noted in issue)\n\n---\n\n### 11. OPTIONAL CONSIDERATION: matrixStats\n\n**Result:** No uses of `apply()` calls found that would benefit from `matrixStats`. The main scoring uses `apply_metrics()` which is a custom wrapper function. No performance optimization opportunities identified with matrixStats."}],"totalDurationMs":42481,"totalTokens":41417,"totalToolUseCount":20,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":657,"cache_read_input_tokens":38780,"output_tokens":1976,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":657,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[]}}}

Consider the following example:\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(123)\nn <- 1000\nobserved <- rnorm(n, 5, 4)^2\n\npredicted_mu <- mean(observed)\npredicted_not_mu <- predicted_mu - rnorm(n, 10, 2)\n\nmean(Metrics::ae(observed, predicted_mu))\nmean(Metrics::ae(observed, predicted_not_mu))\n\nmean(Metrics::se(observed, predicted_mu))\nmean(Metrics::se(observed, predicted_not_mu))\n```\n\n\n\n## Absolute error\n\n**Observation**: $y$, a real number\n\n**Forecast**: $\\hat{y}$, a real number, the median of the forecaster's predictive distribution.\n\nThe absolute error is the absolute difference between the predicted and the observed values. See `?Metrics::ae`.\n\n$$\\text{ae} = |y - \\hat{y}|$$\n\nThe absolute error is only an appropriate rule if $\\hat{y}$ corresponds to the median of the forecaster's predictive distribution. Otherwise, results will be misleading (see @gneitingMakingEvaluatingPoint2011).\n\n## Squared error\n\n**Observation**: $y$, a real number\n\n**Forecast**: $\\hat{y}$, a real number, the mean of the forecaster's predictive distribution.\n\nThe squared error is the squared difference between the predicted and the observed values. See `?Metrics::se`.\n\n$$\\text{se} = (y - \\hat{y})^2$$\nThe squared error is only an appropriate rule if $\\hat{y}$ corresponds to the mean of the forecaster's predictive distribution. Otherwise, results will be misleading (see @gneitingMakingEvaluatingPoint2011).\n\n## Absolute percentage error\n\n**Observation**: $y$, a real number\n\n**Forecast**: $\\hat{y}$, a real number\n\nThe absolute percentage error is the absolute percent difference between the predicted and the observed values. See `?Metrics::ape`.\n\n$$\\text{ape} = \\frac{|y - \\hat{y}|}{|y|}$$\n\nThe absolute percentage error is only an appropriate rule if $\\hat{y}$ corresponds to the $\\beta$-median of the forecaster's predictive distribution with $\\beta = -1$. The $\\beta$-median, $\\text{med}^{(\\beta)}(F)$, is the median of a random variable whose density is proportional to $y^\\beta f(y)$. The specific $\\beta$-median that corresponds to the absolute percentage error is $\\text{med}^{(-1)}(F)$. Otherwise, results will be misleading (see @gneitingMakingEvaluatingPoint2011).\n\n---\n\n# Binary forecasts\n\nSee a list of the default metrics for point forecasts by calling `?get_metrics(example_binary)`.","numLines":60,"startLine":50,"totalLines":493}}}

(2) `matrixStats` not adopted; 3 `apply()` calls in `R/metrics-sample.R` could benefit. Suggest splitting into two sub-tasks, prioritizing `Metrics` removal as a quick win.\n\n## Context\n\nThe `Metrics` package provides three trivially simple functions used by scoringutils:\n- `Metrics::ae(actual, predicted)` = `abs(actual - predicted)`\n- `Metrics::se(actual, predicted)` = `(actual - predicted)^2`\n- `Metrics::ape(actual, predicted)` = `abs(actual - predicted) / abs(actual)`\n\nThese are referenced in:\n1. `R/class-forecast-point.R` lines 148-150: `get_metrics.forecast_point()` uses `Metrics::ae`, `Metrics::se`, `Metrics::ape`\n2. `R/class-forecast-point.R` line 78: `@importFrom Metrics se ae ape`\n3. `R/class-forecast-point.R` lines 103-105: roxygen documentation cross-references `[Metrics::ae()]`, `[Metrics::se()]`, `[Metrics::ape()]`\n4. `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd` lines 61-65: Direct usage in examples (`Metrics::ae()`, `Metrics::se()`)\n5. `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd` lines 76, 88, 99: Documentation references (`?Metrics::ae`, `?Metrics::se`, `?Metrics::ape`)\n6. `DESCRIPTION`: `Metrics` in Imports\n7. `NAMESPACE`: three `importFrom(Metrics,ae)`, `importFrom(Metrics,ape)`, `importFrom(Metrics,se)` lines\n\nThe fix replaces `Metrics::ae`, `Metrics::se`, `Metrics::ape` with internal one-liner implementations and removes the `Metrics` package dependency.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-point.R` (existing) and `tests/testthat/test-metrics-point.R` (existing)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat + data.table fixtures; `setup.R` pre-computes `scores_point <- score(example_point)`; existing tests validate `ae_point` via `abs(y - point_forecast)` pattern; no direct Metrics function testing exists — all validation goes through `score()`\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"internal ae replacement produces identical results to Metrics::ae\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: Ensures the internal replacement for `Metrics::ae` is numerically identical to the original\n**Setup**:\n- Create two numeric vectors: `observed <- c(1, -15, 22, 0, 5.5)` and `predicted <- c(5, 6, 7, 0, 5.5)`\n- Expected result: `abs(observed - predicted)` which equals `c(4, 21, 15, 0, 0)`\n**Action**:\n- Retrieve the `ae_point` metric function from `get_metrics(example_point, select = \"ae_point\")` (this is a list with one element)\n- Call the function: `ae_fn <- get_metrics(example_point, select = \"ae_point\")[[1]]; ae_fn(observed, predicted)`\n**Expected**:\n- `expect_identical(ae_fn(observed, predicted), abs(observed - predicted))`\n- Must return a numeric vector of the same length as input\n- Must handle zero difference: `expect_identical(ae_fn(5, 5), 0)`\n- Must handle negative values: `expect_identical(ae_fn(-10, 5), 15)`\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS both before and after the fix (the mathematical behavior is identical).

The argument count check validates the internal implementations match the `Metrics` function signatures (both take exactly 2 args: `actual`, `predicted`).\n\n### Note on vignette references\n\nThe vignette `scoring-rules.Rmd` uses `Metrics::ae()` and `Metrics::se()` in code chunks (lines 61-65) and references `?Metrics::ae`, `?Metrics::se`, `?Metrics::ape` in prose (lines 76, 88, 99).

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature). If yes, run `usethis::use_release_issue()` and proceed with CRAN submission. If not, close the issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1064 | Pre-ranking for multivariate calibration assessment | | 2026-01-30 | feature | medium | large | no | No pre-ranking or multivariate calibration diagnostics exist in the codebase. The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al. (2008) as calibration diagnostics for multivariate forecasts, after resolving the API design choice with maintainers. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1057 | Revise README to remove news about the package rewrite | documentation | 2026-01-29 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Open, no assignee. The rewrite messaging and Google Drive paper links appear in 4 locations in README.Rmd. Mechanical edits are straightforward but replacement text requires editorial decisions about where to point users for documentation. | Loosely related to #810 (pkgdown for dev docs) and #759 (future of scoringutils.Rmd vignette). | Edit `README.Rmd` to remove/soften the \"major re-write\" paragraph and replace Google Drive paper links with pointers to package vignettes/docs, then re-render README.md. Confirm preferred documentation hierarchy with maintainers first. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1055 | Model confidence sets | feature request | 2026-01-19 | feature | medium | large | no | Design phase — methodology not yet agreed upon. 6 comments with active debate. Naive pairwise p-value approach acknowledged as incomplete. Three alternatives discussed: Hansen et al. MCS, novel extension for incomplete sets, Bayesian approach. No consensus reached. | Relates to #750 (p-value computation refactor), #769 (pairwise comparison arguments), #37 (Diebold-Mariano test), #1022 (two-model pairwise). | Resolve design consensus on which MCS methodology to implement (Hansen et al. on complete sets, novel incomplete-set extension, or Bayesian), then implement `get_model_confidence_set()` building on existing pairwise comparison infrastructure. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1046 | multivariate scoring in scoring rules vignette | documentation | 2025-11-04 | documentation | low | small | partially | Open, agreed upon by maintainers. The scoring-rules vignette has zero mentions of multivariate scoring. A dedicated multivariate vignette already exists. Only a cross-reference and brief section are missing. | None. All underlying code and the dedicated multivariate vignette already exist. | Add a short section to `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd` describing the energy score for multivariate forecasts and cross-linking to the existing `scoring-multivariate-forecasts` vignette. No code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1044 | Remove the commented out vignette code. | | 2025-09-23 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Two HTML comment blocks remain: a WIP \"Details on the grouping\" section in `scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` (lines 88-102) and a ~50-line PIT/Calibration section in `scoring-rules.Rmd` (lines 444-493). Originated from PR #998 review comment. | None. | Delete the two HTML-commented-out code blocks from `vignettes/scoring-multivariate-forecasts.Rmd` and `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd`. Optionally confirm with maintainers whether the PIT/Calibration text should be preserved elsewhere. | N/A | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1043 | Update print method for multivariate forecasts to show `joint_across` | | 2025-09-21 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output. Update test snapshots. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1026 | as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile | enhancement | 2025-07-13 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. The reverse conversion (`as_forecast_quantile.forecast_sample`) exists, but `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile` does not. No distribution-fitting dependencies in DESCRIPTION. Author plans to borrow from hubverse approach. | Related to #557 (sample_to_quantile.numeric). May introduce new dependency (e.g., `distfromq`). | Implement `as_forecast_sample.forecast_quantile()` S3 method that fits a distribution or uses interpolation to approximate the predictive CDF from quantiles and draws samples. Requires design decision on approximation method and potential new package dependency. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1022 | Let `get_pairwise_comparison()` run with two models? | | 2025-07-03 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error. Update test expectations and fix the \"compairisons\" typo. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 1002 | LaTeX not rendering in function reference | | 2025-05-20 | documentation | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. pkgdown defaults to `mathml` which doesn't handle the 63 `\\eqn{}`/`\\deqn{}` occurrences in 4 metrics files. Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site. One-line config change fixes all 63 LaTeX expressions across 4 documentation files. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 986 | Test scores are correct | | 2025-02-21 | enhancement | medium | medium | partially | Still relevant. WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette. The scoring-rules vignette mentions local/global in text only, with no visual. Code to regenerate is in the issue body. | Sibling issues: #929, #930, #933 (all repurpose manuscript illustrations). Consider batching. | Add the existing `score-locality.png` to `scoring-rules.Rmd` (or a new comparative vignette) with an explanatory paragraph on local vs. global scoring rules.

Related to #759 (vignette future). | Create a new \"Choosing a scoring rule\" vignette (per #758's stub) or integrate `score-convergence-outliers.png` into `scoring-rules.Rmd` with explanatory text on sample convergence and score properties. Best addressed as a batch with #929/#930/#934 under #758. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 930 | Use nice illustration of the effect of increasing the mean on increasing average scores | documentation | 2024-09-27 | documentation | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `illustration-effect-scale.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned. A deleted stub vignette (`Choosing-a-score.Rmd`) once referenced it. Author expressed uncertainty (\"maybe we don't want it anymore\").

Unlike siblings (#930, #933, #934), the calibration/sharpness PNG does **not** exist in the repo — it was never generated. Code to create it is in the issue body. The `scoring-rules.Rmd` has a commented-out calibration section (lines ~449-492) where this illustration would naturally fit. | Sibling issues #930, #933, #934. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #759 (vignette future), #785 (vignette updates). | Generate `calibration-sharpness-illustration.png` from the code in the issue body, place in `vignettes/`, and integrate into `scoring-rules.Rmd` (or a new \"Choosing a score\" vignette). Coordinate with #930/#933/#934 batch. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 927 | Make all internal columns, in particular `forecast_id`, more robust by prefixing it with \"scoringutils_\" | good first issue, high-priority | 2024-09-26 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. Unprefixed internal columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) risk collision with user data columns. Codebase already mixes two conventions: `.scoringutils_*` (e.g., `.scoringutils_N`) and `scoringutils_Internal*`. ~3 source files, 1 globalVariables file, 1 snapshot to update for `forecast_id` alone. Not a breaking change — all affected columns are internal. | None blocking. Self-contained refactor. | Rename unprefixed internal temp columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) to `.scoringutils_` prefix, matching existing convention. Update `R/helper-quantile-interval-range.R`, `R/metrics-quantile.R`, `R/z-globalVariables.R`, and test snapshots. Also unify the two naming conventions (`.scoringutils_*` vs `scoringutils_Internal*`). | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 922 | remove `check_columns_present` | | 2024-09-25 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `check_columns_present` (and `test_columns_present`) are internal functions with 10 call sites across 9 files. All can be replaced by `checkmate::assert_subset`/`check_subset`/`test_subset` (already a dependency). One call site in `pairwise-comparisons.R:143` uses a custom error message and needs slightly different handling. No user-facing API impact. | Related to #839 (remove `test_columns_not_present`) — both modify `R/check-input-helpers.R`, should be batched. | Replace all 10 call sites of `check_columns_present` (and 1 of `test_columns_present`) with equivalent `checkmate` functions, then delete both functions and their tests. Consider batching with #839. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 909 | Compact version of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` | enhancement, good first issue, help wanted | 2024-09-13 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Already implemented. The `counts` parameter on `get_duplicate_forecasts()` provides exactly the compact output requested. Tests exist. Issue can be closed. | None | Close this issue — the `counts` argument already provides compact/aggregated duplicate output. No further code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 907 | coverage of function factory | enhancement | 2024-09-12 | enhancement | low | small | partially | Still relevant. No factory helper exists. Users must manually use `purrr::partial()` (documented in `score()` docs). Only `interval_coverage` benefits currently.

The message in `assert_forecast_generic()` (line 150 of `R/class-forecast.R`) still says the generic \"Some rows containing NA values may be removed\" without a row count. No NA info in `print.forecast`, no `get_na()` helper. The `anyNA()` check and `na.omit()` call are already in place, so computing the count is trivial. | Near-duplicate of #581 (NA count in print method) — should be resolved together. Related to #731 (wis NA warnings). | Minimal fix: add NA row count to the existing `cli_inform` message in `assert_forecast_generic()`.

No progress made. `validate_metrics()` only checks that items are functions (via `checkmate::check_function`), not signature compatibility, output shape, or runtime behavior. Custom metric errors are silently converted to warnings by `run_safely()`, making debugging hard. Each of the 6+ forecast types passes different arguments to metrics. | Loosely related to #362 (non-standard metric I/O), #823 (reduce `try()`). | Implement an exported `test_metrics()` function that runs each metric on a small representative subset of a forecast object and reports informative diagnostics: signature compatibility, runtime errors, and output shape validation.

The issue concerns the one-to-one correspondence between quantile-format and interval-format metric functions. Currently: `interval_score()` is internal (not exported), called by `wis()` after `quantile_to_interval()` conversion. Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases.
