Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature).

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns. Requires either storing `joint_across` as an attribute during object construction or computing it as the set difference between forecast unit and `get_grouping()` output.

The check at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` calls `cli_abort()` when `length(setdiff(comparators, baseline)) < 2`, blocking the 2-models-with-baseline case. Maintainer has expressed agreement to change to a warning. Also has typo \"compairisons\". | None. Self-contained change. | Change the `cli_abort()` to `cli_warn()` at line 162 of `R/pairwise-comparisons.R` so that 2 models with one as baseline emits a warning instead of an error.

Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site.

WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    35→| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    36→| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    37→| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    38→| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n    39→| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    40→| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    41→| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs.

Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n    43→| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Exported quantile metrics: `wis()`, `quantile_score()`, `interval_coverage()`, `ae_median_quantile()`, `bias_quantile()`, `dispersion_quantile()`, `overprediction_quantile()`, `underprediction_quantile()`. No `forecast_interval` class exists — interval format is internal only. The comment from the maintainer (\"not expose functions to users for now and rethink later\") is the current policy. Coverage code in `get_coverage()` still has its own inline computation rather than reusing `interval_coverage()`. | Related to #668 (coverage type argument), #492 (expose `get_range_from_quantile`), #870 (CRPS/WIS decomposition refactor), #907 (coverage function factory), #454 (deduplicate coverage code), #484 (functions to expose). | Keep open as a design discussion for future releases. The immediate question (whether to expose interval-format functions) was deferred. The broader question of code reuse between `get_coverage()` and `interval_coverage()` overlaps with #454 and #668.

The pragmatic pattern (non-standard metrics live outside `score()` as standalone functions) is established.

The highest factor level is assumed to be the reference level.\n  This means that corresponding value in `predicted` represent the\n  probability that the observed value is equal to the highest factor level.\n```\n\n**Implementation (Lines 99 and 122 in R/metrics-binary.R):**\n```r\n# In brier_score():\nobserved <- as.numeric(observed) - 1\n\n# In logs_binary():\nobserved <- as.numeric(observed) - 1\n```\n\n**The Problem:**\nWhen R converts a factor to numeric, it uses the **position** in the levels vector:\n- `factor(c(0, 1), levels = c(0, 1))` → `as.numeric()` gives `c(1, 2)` → minus 1 → `c(0, 1)` ✓\n- `factor(c(0, 1), levels = c(1, 0))` → `as.numeric()` gives `c(2, 1)` → minus 1 → `c(1, 0)` ✗\n\n**Demonstrated Impact:**\n```r\n# Test with levels = c(0, 1) - CORRECT\nobs1 <- factor(c(0, 1, 1), levels = c(0, 1))\npred1 <- c(0.2, 0.8, 0.9)\nbrier_score(obs1, pred1)  # [1] 0.04 0.04 0.01 - GOOD scores\n\n# Test with levels = c(1, 0) - WRONG INTERPRETATION\nobs2 <- factor(c(0, 1, 1), levels = c(1, 0))\npred2 <- c(0.2, 0.8, 0.9)  # SAME predictions\nbrier_score(obs2, pred2)  # [1] 0.64 0.64 0.81 - BAD scores\n```\n\nThe same predictions produce completely different scores just by changing factor level order!\n\n---\n\n### 3. **R/check-input-helpers.R - Validation Functions**\n\n**check_input_binary() (Lines 30-33 in R/metrics-binary.R):**\n```r\ncheck_input_binary <- function(observed, predicted) {\n  result <- check_try(assert_input_binary(observed, predicted))\n  return(result)\n}\n```\n\nSimply wraps `assert_input_binary()` - no additional validation.\n\n**Other helper functions in check-input-helpers.R:**\n- `check_columns_present()` (Lines 74-97)\n- `test_columns_present()` (Lines 106-109)\n- `test_columns_not_present()` (Lines 119-121)\n\nNone of these check factor level consistency.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-binary.R - Test Coverage**\n\n**What IS tested:**\n- Correct conversion via `as_forecast_binary()` (Lines 4-8)\n- Detection of superfluous columns like `sample_id` (Lines 26-37)\n- Validation that probabilities are in [0, 1] (Lines 39-46)\n- Scoring produces expected output format (Lines 53-76)\n- Handling of NA values (Lines 78-87)\n\n**What IS NOT tested:**\n- Different factor level orderings\n- Factor level consistency across observations\n- Warning/error when levels are reversed\n- Validation that levels match documentation expectations\n\n---\n\n### 5. **tests/testthat/helper-*.R and setup.R - Test Fixtures**\n\n**setup.R (Lines 1-26):**\nSets up pre-computed scores for all forecast types:\n```r\nscores_binary <- score(example_binary)\n```\n\n**No helper-*.R files exist** - no custom test helpers for binary forecasts.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **example_binary Dataset Structure**\n\n**Creation (inst/create-example-data.R, Lines 218-246):**\n```r\nexample_binary <- data.table::copy(example_sample_continuous)\n# ... calculations ...\nexample_binary[, observed := factor(as.numeric(observed))]\n```\n\n**Factor levels:** `c(\"0\", \"1\")` (confirmed via inspection)\n\n**Data structure:**\n```\nClasses: 'forecast_binary', 'forecast', 'data.table', 'data.frame'\n1031 observations of 9 variables:\n- observed: Factor w/ 2 levels \"0\",\"1\"\n- predicted: num (probabilities)\n```\n\nThe example data consistently uses levels `c(\"0\", \"1\")`, which means the \"highest level\" is \"1\".\n\n---\n\n### 7. **R/metrics-binary.R - Binary Scoring Functions**\n\n**Detailed documentation (Lines 43-57):**\n```r\n#' A factor `observed = factor(c(0, 1, 1, 0, 1)` with two levels (`0` and `1`)\n#' would internally be coerced to a numeric vector (in this case this would\n#' result in the numeric vector `c(1, 2, 2, 1, 1)`). After subtracting 1, the\n#' resulting vector (`c(0, 1, 1, 0)` in this case) is used for internal\n#' calculations. All predictions are assumed represent the probability that the\n#' outcome is equal of the last/highest factor level (in this case that the\n#' outcome is equal to 1).\n#'\n#' You could alternatively also provide a vector like\n#' `observed = factor(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"a\"))` (with two levels, `a` and `b`),\n#' which would result in exactly the same internal representation. Probabilities\n#' then represent the probability that the outcome is equal to \"b\".\n#' If you want your predictions to be probabilities that the outcome is \"a\",\n#' then you could of course make `observed` a factor with levels swapped, i.e.\n#' `observed = factor(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"a\"), levels = c(\"b\", \"a\"))`\n```\n\n**This documentation acknowledges** that level order matters but:\n- Assumes users will intentionally swap levels if needed\n- Doesn't warn about the danger of accidental inconsistency\n- Doesn't provide validation\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Comparison: Ordinal and Nominal Forecasts DO Validate Levels**\n\n**Ordinal validation (R/class-forecast-ordinal.R, Lines 90-98):**\n```r\nobserved_levels <- levels(forecast$observed)\npredicted_label_levels <- levels(forecast$predicted_label)\nif (!identical(predicted_label_levels, observed_levels)) {\n  cli_abort(\n    \"Levels of `predicted_label` and `observed` must be identical\n    and in the same order. Found levels {.val {predicted_label_levels}}\n    and {.val {observed_levels}}.\"\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Ordinal metric validation (R/metrics-ordinal.R, Lines 23-29):**\n```r\nif (!identical(levels(predicted_label), levels(observed))) {\n  cli_abort(\n    \"Levels of `predicted_label` and `observed` must be identical\n    and in the same order. Found levels {.val {levels(predicted_label)}}\n    and {.val {levels(observed)}}.\"\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Key difference:** Ordinal/nominal forecasts have explicit level consistency checks because they have a `predicted_label` column to compare against. Binary forecasts only have `observed` and `predicted` (numeric), so there's no natural comparison point.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **No Existing Factor Level Order Checks**\n\n**Search results:**\n- No tests for `factor.*level.*test` or `test.*factor.*level`\n- No validation functions checking level order\n- No warnings about level consistency\n- Ordinal forecasts check that `predicted_label` and `observed` levels match\n- **Binary forecasts have NO equivalent check**\n\nThe only mention of \"highest level\" or \"reference level\" appears in documentation, not validation code.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Documentation in man/scoring-functions-binary.Rd**\n\n**Lines 50-69 contain detailed explanation:**\n```\nThe functions require users to provide observed values as a factor in order\nto distinguish its input from the input format required for scoring point\nforecasts. Internally, however, factors will be converted to numeric values.\nA factor `observed = factor(c(0, 1, 1, 0, 1)` with two levels (`0` and `1`)\nwould internally be coerced to a numeric vector (in this case this would\nresult in the numeric vector `c(1, 2, 2, 1, 1)`). After subtracting 1, the\nresulting vector (`c(0, 1, 1, 0)` in this case) is used for internal\ncalculations. All predictions are assumed represent the probability that the\noutcome is equal of the last/highest factor level (in this case that the\noutcome is equal to 1).\n```\n\n**The documentation is thorough** but assumes expert-level R knowledge about how factors work internally.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Insights and Recommendations**\n\n1. **Silent Failure Mode:** Users can create binary forecasts with reversed factor levels (`c(1, 0)` instead of `c(0, 1)`), and the package will silently produce incorrect scores without any warning.\n\n2. **No Validation Exists:** Unlike ordinal/nominal forecasts that validate level consistency, binary forecasts have no such checks.\n\n3. **Documentation Gap:** While the documentation explains the conversion process, it doesn't warn about the dangers or provide best practices for ensuring consistency.\n\n4. **Test Coverage Gap:** No tests verify that the package handles or rejects different factor level orderings appropriately.\n\n5. **Comparison with Other Forecast Types:** The ordinal forecast implementation provides a good template for what validation should look like (checking level identity and order).\n\n6. **Real-World Impact:** A user who naturally creates factors with levels `c(TRUE, FALSE)` or `c(1, 0)` would get completely wrong scores without any indication of error.\n\nThis analysis reveals a significant gap in input validation that could lead to silent errors in user code, particularly for users who may not be deeply familiar with R's factor internals."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: ab46832 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 60840\ntool_uses: 43\nduration_ms: 193928</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6bbae4ee-ba5c-4293-b37c-866678caa4c2","uuid":"ee8d279b-07b8-4c79-b985-a1f9a9509c63","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the scoringutils R package codebase at /Users/nikos/github-synced/scoringutils-pipeline to understand how binary forecast validation and scoring works.

Optionally create `as_binary_observed()` helper with a `reference_level` argument for safe factor conversion.\n- **Status Note**: Still relevant. No code warns when 0/1 factor levels are in counterintuitive order (e.g., `levels = c(1, 0)` making `0` the reference level). `assert_input_binary()` only validates factor with 2 levels and predicted in [0,1]. No helper for safe factor conversion exists. @seabbs questioned whether this is must-have or nice-to-have.\n\n## Test Specifications\n\n**Designed**: 2026-02-13\n**Test file**: `tests/testthat/test-class-forecast-binary.R` (existing) and `tests/testthat/test-metrics-binary.R` (existing)\n**Testing patterns observed**: testthat with data.table fixtures; `example_binary` dataset used throughout; `scores_binary` pre-computed in `setup.R`; `suppressMessages()` used around `as_forecast_binary()` calls; `cli_abort()`/`cli_warn()` condition checking via `expect_error()`/`expect_warning()`\n\n### Test 1: test_that(\"assert_input_binary() warns when 0/1 factor levels are in counterintuitive order\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the core issue — no warning when factor levels `c(1, 0)` silently reverse the interpretation of predictions\n**Setup**:\n- `observed <- factor(c(0, 1, 1, 0, 1), levels = c(\"1\", \"0\"))` — levels are reversed from the natural order\n- `predicted <- c(0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.2, 0.7)` — probabilities intended for outcome \"1\"\n**Action**:\n- Call `assert_input_binary(observed, predicted)`\n**Expected**:\n- Should emit a `cli_warn()` indicating that the factor levels appear to be in counterintuitive order — specifically that the levels are `c(\"1\", \"0\")` and predictions will be interpreted as the probability of observing `\"0\"` (the highest/last level), which is likely unintended\n**Fails now because**:\n- `assert_input_binary()` only checks `assert_factor(observed, n.levels = 2)`, `assert_numeric(predicted, lower = 0, upper = 1)`, and `assert_dims_ok_point()`. It performs no check on factor level ordering. The function returns `invisible(NULL)` without any warning.\n\n### Test 2: test_that(\"assert_input_binary() does not warn for standard 0/1 level order\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: ensures the warning is not a false positive for the normal/expected case\n**Setup**:\n- `observed <- factor(c(0, 1, 1, 0, 1), levels = c(\"0\", \"1\"))` — standard level order where \"1\" is the highest level\n- `predicted <- c(0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.2, 0.7)`\n**Action**:\n- Call `assert_input_binary(observed, predicted)`\n**Expected**:\n- Should return `invisible(NULL)` with no warning emitted\n- Use `expect_no_warning(assert_input_binary(observed, predicted))`\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code (no warning is emitted). It serves as a regression guard to ensure the new warning logic does not trigger for the standard case.\n\n### Test 3: test_that(\"assert_input_binary() does not warn for non-numeric factor levels\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: ensures the check only triggers for clearly 0/1-like level names, not arbitrary text labels\n**Setup**:\n- `observed <- factor(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"a\"), levels = c(\"a\", \"b\"))` — text levels, no \"natural\" order to warn about\n- `predicted <- c(0.3, 0.7, 0.6, 0.4)`\n**Action**:\n- Call `assert_input_binary(observed, predicted)`\n**Expected**:\n- Should return `invisible(NULL)` with no warning emitted\n- Use `expect_no_warning(assert_input_binary(observed, predicted))`\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code. It is a regression guard ensuring the warning only fires for 0/1-like levels where order is counterintuitive, not for arbitrary label names.\n\n### Test 4: test_that(\"brier_score() produces different results with reversed factor levels\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: demonstrates the silent incorrect scoring that the issue describes\n**Setup**:\n- `observed_correct <- factor(c(0, 1, 1, 0), levels = c(\"0\", \"1\"))` — correct level order\n- `observed_reversed <- factor(c(0, 1, 1, 0), levels = c(\"1\", \"0\"))` — reversed level order\n- `predicted <- c(0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.2)` — predictions intended as P(outcome = 1)\n**Action**:\n- `scores_correct <- brier_score(observed_correct, predicted)`\n- `scores_reversed <- brier_score(observed_reversed, predicted)` — should now emit a warning\n**Expected**:\n- `scores_correct` should be `c(0.01, 0.01, 0.04, 0.04)` (small errors for good predictions)\n- `scores_reversed` should NOT equal `scores_correct` (demonstrating the reversal causes different scores)\n- After the fix, calling `brier_score()` with reversed levels should emit a warning (because `assert_input_binary()` is called inside `brier_score()`)\n- Use `expect_warning(brier_score(observed_reversed, predicted), <pattern matching the level-order warning>)`\n**Fails now because**:\n- Currently `brier_score()` calls `assert_input_binary()` which does not warn about level order. The reversed-level call silently succeeds with `scores_reversed = c(0.81, 0.81, 0.64, 0.64)` — completely wrong — with no indication to the user.\n\n### Test 5: test_that(\"logs_binary() warns with reversed 0/1 factor levels\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: same issue as Test 4 but for the other binary scoring function\n**Setup**:\n- `observed_reversed <- factor(c(0, 1, 1, 0), levels = c(\"1\", \"0\"))` — reversed level order\n- `predicted <- c(0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.2)`\n**Action**:\n- Call `logs_binary(observed_reversed, predicted)`\n**Expected**:\n- Should emit the same level-order warning as `brier_score()`, since both call `assert_input_binary()`\n- Use `expect_warning(logs_binary(observed_reversed, predicted), <pattern matching the level-order warning>)`\n**Fails now because**:\n- `logs_binary()` calls `assert_input_binary()` which does not warn about level order. The call silently succeeds with incorrect scores.\n\n### Test 6: test_that(\"as_forecast_binary() warns when data has reversed 0/1 factor levels\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: the issue at the forecast-object creation level, not just at scoring time\n**Setup**:\n- Create a small data.table with binary forecast structure:\n  ```\n  dt <- data.table(\n    model = \"m1\",\n    observed = factor(c(0, 1, 1, 0), levels = c(\"1\", \"0\")),\n    predicted = c(0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.2)\n  )\n  ```\n**Action**:\n- Call `as_forecast_binary(dt)`\n**Expected**:\n- Should emit a warning about the counterintuitive factor level order during the `assert_forecast()` step (which calls `check_input_binary()` → `assert_input_binary()`)\n- The forecast object should still be created (it's a warning, not an error)\n- Use `expect_warning(as_forecast_binary(dt), <pattern matching the level-order warning>)`\n**Fails now because**:\n- `assert_forecast.forecast_binary()` calls `check_input_binary()` which delegates to `assert_input_binary()`. None of these check factor level order, so no warning is emitted. The forecast object is created silently with the reversed levels.\n\n### Test 7: test_that(\"assert_input_binary() warns for TRUE/FALSE levels in counterintuitive order\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: a variant of the issue for boolean-like factor levels\n**Setup**:\n- `observed <- factor(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), levels = c(\"TRUE\", \"FALSE\"))` — \"TRUE\" is the first (lower) level, \"FALSE\" is the second (higher/reference) level. Predictions would be interpreted as P(outcome = FALSE), which is counterintuitive.\n- `predicted <- c(0.8, 0.2, 0.9)`\n**Action**:\n- Call `assert_input_binary(observed, predicted)`\n**Expected**:\n- Should emit a warning that the factor level order may be counterintuitive. With `levels = c(\"TRUE\", \"FALSE\")`, the highest level is `\"FALSE\"`, so `predicted` is interpreted as P(outcome = FALSE). Users almost certainly intend `predicted` to represent P(outcome = TRUE).\n- Use `expect_warning(assert_input_binary(observed, predicted), <pattern matching the level-order warning>)`\n**Fails now because**:\n- `assert_input_binary()` does not inspect level names or their ordering semantics. No warning is emitted regardless of how misleading the level order is.\n\n### Test 8: test_that(\"score() produces correct results with standard 0/1 factor levels\", { ... })\n\n**Reproduces**: regression guard ensuring the fix doesn't break normal scoring\n**Setup**:\n- Use `example_binary` dataset (which has standard `levels = c(\"0\", \"1\")`)\n**Action**:\n- Call `score(example_binary)`\n**Expected**:\n- Should produce the same results as `scores_binary` (pre-computed in `setup.R`)\n- No warnings should be emitted related to factor level order\n- Use `expect_no_warning(score(example_binary))` (or `suppressMessages()` to ignore non-level-related messages, then check no level-order warning)\n**Fails now because**:\n- This test should PASS against current code.

Dev version (2.1.2.9000) has multivariate feature + bug fix accumulated over 161 days. No blocking bugs. Two open PRs (#1060, #1062) are infrastructure changes. | Maintainers should decide whether to merge #1060/#1062 before releasing. | Decide whether to cut a new release (likely v2.2.0 given multivariate feature). If yes, run `usethis::use_release_issue()` and proceed with CRAN submission. If not, close the issue. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 1064 | Pre-ranking for multivariate calibration assessment | | 2026-01-30 | feature | medium | large | no | No pre-ranking or multivariate calibration diagnostics exist in the codebase. The `forecast_sample_multivariate` class and energy score are implemented and stable. Design decision needed: integrate into `score()` (Option A) or standalone `get_multivariate_ranks()` function (Option B). MST method may need `igraph` dependency. | None blocking. Builds on existing `forecast_sample_multivariate` infrastructure. | Implement pre-ranking methods (multivariate rank, optionally MST rank) from Gneiting et al.

No `print.forecast_sample_multivariate` method exists; the generic `print.forecast` handles all types. `joint_across` is not stored as an attribute — `set_grouping()` computes `.mv_group_id` but discards the original `joint_across` value. | Builds on multivariate infrastructure from merged PR #998. | Add a `print.forecast_sample_multivariate()` method that displays `joint_across` columns.

Upstream r-lib/pkgdown#2704 is closed (won't fix mathml); recommended fix is to use `mathjax` or `katex`. No `math-rendering` setting exists in `_pkgdown.yml`. | None internally. CRAN release needed for release site fix. | Add `math-rendering: katex` (or `mathjax`) under the `template:` key in `_pkgdown.yml` and rebuild the pkgdown site.

WIS has reference tests (CovidHubUtils), `logs_binary` validates against `Metrics::ll`, `rps_ordinal` against `scoringRules::rps_probs`. But CRPS/DSS/log_score for sample-based forecasts, dispersion, overprediction, underprediction lack absolute-value tests. No snapshot tests pin numerical outputs on example datasets. | None | Add (1) snapshot tests pinning `score()` output on each built-in example dataset, and (2) targeted correctness tests validating key sample-based scoring functions against known analytical solutions or external reference implementations. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 983 | Create `.data.frame` methods for `as_forecast<type>` | | 2025-01-14 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Prerequisite #981 (making `as_forecast_*` S3 generics) is done. Currently all 7 types only have `.default` methods; no `.data.frame` methods exist. The `.default` methods silently accept any type and rely on `as.data.table()` coercion deep inside. | #981 (done). No blockers. | Rename the 7 existing `.default` methods to `.data.frame` (since they assume data.frame-like input), then create new `.default` methods that error with a helpful message about unsupported types. Update NAMESPACE, docs, and tests. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 975 | Add link to score definitions in `summarise_score()` | | 2024-11-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No `print.scores` method exists anywhere in the codebase. Scores objects fall through to data.table's default print. The scoring rules vignette exists at the expected URL. Maintainers favor option 1 (link to docs) over printing definitions. | Closely related to #667 (create `print.scores` method). Should be aware of #935 (print side-effects on column mutation). | Create a `print.scores()` S3 method in `R/class-scores.R` that calls `NextMethod()` then appends a `cli_text()` link to the scoring rules vignette. Ideally coordinate with #667 to also show the metrics used. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 944 | Make `get_metrics()` more customisable | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-08 | enhancement | low | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_metrics()` is an S3 generic with `select`/`exclude` args (via #832/#903), but the proposed `replace` argument for inline metric customization has not been implemented. The `add_args` idea from the issue body is less well-defined. | #832 (done). Related to #789 (documenting customization workflow). | Add a `replace` argument to `select_metrics()` and propagate through all 7 `get_metrics.forecast_*` methods, accepting a named list of functions to substitute by name. Evaluate whether `add_args` is worth implementing or should be dropped. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 942 | Discrimination plots for binary forecasts | enhancement, feature request | 2024-10-07 | feature | low | small | yes | Still relevant. No binary-specific plot functions exist in the codebase. No discrimination plot, reliability diagram, or any binary visualization exists. The `forecast_binary` class and `example_binary` dataset provide exactly the data structures needed. | None. Thematically adjacent to #49 (calibration plotting) and #286 (diagnostics) but no hard dependency. | Implement a new `plot_discrimination()` function that accepts a `forecast_binary` object, groups predicted probabilities by the two levels of observed, and renders overlapping density plots via ggplot2, with optional faceting by model. Add tests and docs. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 941 | Rethink `score()` and maybe make it not S3 anymore | refactor | 2024-10-06 | refactor | medium | medium | no | Still relevant. All 7 `score.forecast_*` S3 methods share near-identical boilerplate (clean, validate, reshape, apply_metrics, as_scores). Only the reshape step differs per type. No refactoring has been done since the issue was opened. Both opener and reviewer agree on the direction. | Related to #338 (cross-type metrics). Benefits from #982 (done). | Refactor `score()` from 7 S3 methods into a single function by extracting the type-specific data reshaping into a new internal S3 generic (e.g., `prepare_for_scoring()`). Requires design decision on the preparation step's interface. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 939 | remove `check_input_<forecast_type>` functions | refactor | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. All 5 `check_input_*` functions exist. 3 (sample, quantile, interval) are unused in production code — only tested. 2 (binary, point) are used in `assert_forecast` methods. Other types (sample, quantile) already skip the check pattern, showing inconsistency. | Supersedes #684 (subset of this issue). | Delete all 5 `check_input_*` functions and their man pages. For the 2 in use (binary, point), refactor call sites to call `assert_input_*` directly or inline `check_try()`, matching the pattern already used by sample/quantile. Close #684 as duplicate. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 938 | Rename/refactor? `assert_dims_ok_point` | refactor, low-priority | 2024-10-03 | refactor | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `assert_dims_ok_point` is used by both `assert_input_point` and `assert_input_binary`, making the `_point` suffix misleading. The function is a general-purpose dimension check. Companion `check_dims_ok_point` also exists. ~5 files to update. | None. | Rename `assert_dims_ok_point` (and `check_dims_ok_point`) to a type-agnostic name (e.g., `assert_dims_ok_scalar` or `assert_dims_match`). Update definition, 2 call sites, tests, and docs. Optionally move out of `metrics-point.R` into a shared file. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 935 | `forecast` and `scores` objects print output every time a column is changed | high-priority | 2024-09-29 | bug | medium | large | no | Still relevant. Core bug unfixed: `print.forecast` dispatches to `print.data.table` via `NextMethod()`, which breaks data.table's internal `:=` print-suppression (call stack too deep for `shouldPrint()`). PR #956 only worked around nominal forecast validation errors with a `nrow > 30` hack. The `scores` side may no longer be affected (no `print.scores` exists). | Related to #667 (print.scores — would reintroduce problem), #685 (suppress printing in tests), #1043 (multivariate print). | Design decision needed: (a) accept cosmetic annoyance, (b) reimplement `print.forecast` without dispatching to `print.data.table` (e.g., use `format.data.table` + manipulate `.global$print`), or (c) pursue upstream data.table fix per @MichaelChirico's suggestion. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 934 | Use illustration of local and global scores | documentation | 2024-09-28 | documentation | low | small | partially | Still relevant. `score-locality.png` already exists in `vignettes/` but is orphaned — not referenced by any vignette.

Unlike siblings (#930, #933, #934), the calibration/sharpness PNG does **not** exist in the repo — it was never generated. Code to create it is in the issue body. The `scoring-rules.Rmd` has a commented-out calibration section (lines ~449-492) where this illustration would naturally fit. | Sibling issues #930, #933, #934. Related to #758 (scoring rules vignette), #759 (vignette future), #785 (vignette updates). | Generate `calibration-sharpness-illustration.png` from the code in the issue body, place in `vignettes/`, and integrate into `scoring-rules.Rmd` (or a new \"Choosing a score\" vignette). Coordinate with #930/#933/#934 batch. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 927 | Make all internal columns, in particular `forecast_id`, more robust by prefixing it with \"scoringutils_\" | good first issue, high-priority | 2024-09-26 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. Unprefixed internal columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) risk collision with user data columns. Codebase already mixes two conventions: `.scoringutils_*` (e.g., `.scoringutils_N`) and `scoringutils_Internal*`. ~3 source files, 1 globalVariables file, 1 snapshot to update for `forecast_id` alone. Not a breaking change — all affected columns are internal. | None blocking. Self-contained refactor. | Rename unprefixed internal temp columns (`forecast_id`, `weight`, `boundary`) to `.scoringutils_` prefix, matching existing convention. Update `R/helper-quantile-interval-range.R`, `R/metrics-quantile.R`, `R/z-globalVariables.R`, and test snapshots. Also unify the two naming conventions (`.scoringutils_*` vs `scoringutils_Internal*`). | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 922 | remove `check_columns_present` | | 2024-09-25 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `check_columns_present` (and `test_columns_present`) are internal functions with 10 call sites across 9 files. All can be replaced by `checkmate::assert_subset`/`check_subset`/`test_subset` (already a dependency). One call site in `pairwise-comparisons.R:143` uses a custom error message and needs slightly different handling. No user-facing API impact. | Related to #839 (remove `test_columns_not_present`) — both modify `R/check-input-helpers.R`, should be batched. | Replace all 10 call sites of `check_columns_present` (and 1 of `test_columns_present`) with equivalent `checkmate` functions, then delete both functions and their tests. Consider batching with #839. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 909 | Compact version of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` | enhancement, good first issue, help wanted | 2024-09-13 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Already implemented. The `counts` parameter on `get_duplicate_forecasts()` provides exactly the compact output requested. Tests exist. Issue can be closed. | None | Close this issue — the `counts` argument already provides compact/aggregated duplicate output. No further code changes needed. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 907 | coverage of function factory | enhancement | 2024-09-12 | enhancement | low | small | partially | Still relevant. No factory helper exists. Users must manually use `purrr::partial()` (documented in `score()` docs). Only `interval_coverage` benefits currently. Hard-coded 50% and 90% variants in `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()`. Discussion stalled after 5 comments with no consensus on approach. | Related to #451 (quantile/interval metric organization), #668 (coverage flexibility). | Add either a generic `expand_metric()` utility or a `coverage_ranges` argument to `get_metrics.forecast_quantile()` to programmatically generate multiple parameterized coverage metric variants. Needs design decision on approach given only one metric currently benefits. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 898 | Support for \"Mixture of Parameters\" scoring | feature request | 2024-09-06 | feature | low | large | partially | Still relevant but low urgency. No `forecast_distribution` class exists. Prerequisites #832 (metrics S3 rework) and #846 (ordinal class) are done. Original requester has deprioritized. Would require new class, input format design, dispatch to `scoringRules` parametric functions, and mixture handling. | #888 (S3 rework of `get_duplicate_forecasts()` — minor blocker for clean extensibility). Builds on completed #832, #846. | Implement a new `forecast_distribution` class for scoring forecasts expressed as parametric distributions or mixtures, dispatching to `scoringRules`' closed-form scoring functions. Deferred until active demand — keep on `scoringutils-2.x` milestone. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 895 | Check quantile prediction order helper function | enhancement | 2024-08-19 | enhancement | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. Monotonicity check only exists deep in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (metrics-quantile.R:495) as a hard error. No early warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. No user-facing diagnostic function. Issue #412 is the maintainer-created parent with an agreed plan (steps 1 and 3 not done). | Duplicate of / should be resolved together with #412. | Create a user-facing helper (e.g., `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()`) to identify rows where predictions decrease with increasing quantile level, and add a warning in `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()`. Resolves both #895 and #412. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n| 889 | Make `get_protected_columns()` S3 to avoid hard-coding things | high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. `get_protected_columns()` is a plain function with a hard-coded superset of all column names for all forecast types. Not S3. Only 2 call sites (both in `forecast-unit.R`). The `intersect()` filter masks the problem but prevents extensibility for new forecast classes. No progress made. | Coordinate with #888 (same S3 pattern for `get_duplicate_forecasts()`). Unblocks #852 (new forecast class workflow). Largely resolves #740 (`get_forecast_unit` customization). | Convert `get_protected_columns()` into an S3 generic with per-class methods so each forecast type declares its own protected columns. Coordinate with #888 for consistent pattern. | N/A | N/A | — | N/A |\n| 888 | Rework `get_duplicate_forecasts()` to S3 to avoid hard-coding columns and types | high-priority | 2024-08-10 | refactor | high | medium | partially | Still relevant. Function hard-codes `c(\"sample_id\", \"quantile_level\", \"predicted_label\")` in two places instead of dispatching on S3 class. No work done. Codebase has many S3 precedents now. | Coordinate with #889 (same pattern for `get_protected_columns()`). Partially blocks #898, #852. Related to #740. | Convert `get_duplicate_forecasts()` into an S3 generic with per-class methods where each method knows its own type-specific columns.

Remaining: `as_forecast_generic()`, `as_scores()`, `apply_metrics()` still internal; `new_forecast()` ambiguously exported with `@keywords internal`. Design decision needed on which functions to export for custom forecast class authors. | Depends on #746 (closed). Blocks custom forecast class creation. Related to #852 (design workflow for new classes). | Decide final export list for custom forecast class API: export `as_forecast_generic()`, `as_scores()`, `apply_metrics()`, resolve ambiguous `new_forecast()` status, and update NAMESPACE.

PR #985 (Feb 2025) simplified `crps_sample()` decomposition internally, but the structural duplication remains: `crps_sample()`, `wis()`, and `interval_score()` each independently implement `separate_results` branching, and 6 wrapper functions (3 sample + 3 quantile) repeat identical extraction patterns. | Related to #872 (CRPS decomposition reference). Filed during PR #854 review.

Nearly 2 years open with no progress on these items. | Loosely related to #666 (manuscript update re: Google Drive link), #758 (scoring rules vignette parent issue), #1046 (multivariate scoring in same vignette). | Implement the 7 small documentation edits in `vignettes/scoring-rules.Rmd`: remove author field, replace Google Drive link with proper reference, add citations for proper scoring rules and transformed scores, improve `get_metrics` wording, clean whitespace, and add intro paragraph on probabilistic forecast types. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n72:| 780 | Add a `verbose` argument to `as_forecast()` | | 2024-04-05 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `verbose` already exists on `assert_forecast()` and `assert_forecast_generic()` (PR #778) but has not been threaded through to any `as_forecast_<type>()` constructor. ~11 test lines and 1 internal R source line use `suppressMessages`/`suppressWarnings` wrappers around `as_forecast_*` calls, confirming ongoing need. Author acknowledged low urgency but wants it for test cleanup. | None. PR #778 (verbose on `assert_forecast`) already merged; plumbing is in place. | Add `verbose = TRUE` parameter to each `as_forecast_<type>.default()` method, pass it to their `assert_forecast()` calls, guard direct `cli_warn()`/`cli_inform()` calls behind the flag, and replace `suppressMessages`/`suppressWarnings` wrappers in tests and internal code with `verbose = FALSE`. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n73:| 769 | Rethink the way arguments are passed in `get_pairwise_comparisons()` | package improvement | 2024-04-03 | refactor | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `test_type`, `one_sided`, and `n_permutations` are still passed via `...` through 3 levels (`get_pairwise_comparisons` → `pairwise_comparison_one_group` → `compare_forecasts`). Users must read internal `compare_forecasts` docs to discover options. PR #994 added `test_type = NULL` but didn't address the `...` pattern. #750 (split out p-values) was deferred. | Loosely related to #750 (if p-values split out, this becomes moot — but #750 deferred indefinitely). No hard blockers. | Promote `test_type`, `one_sided`, and `n_permutations` from `...` to explicit named arguments in `get_pairwise_comparisons()` and `add_relative_skill()`, improving API discoverability.

No code warns when 0/1 factor levels are in counterintuitive order (e.g., `levels = c(1, 0)` making `0` the reference level). `assert_input_binary()` only validates factor with 2 levels and predicted in [0,1]. No helper for safe factor conversion exists. @seabbs questioned whether this is must-have for 2.0 or nice-to-have. | Loosely related to #840 (input check cleanup) and #939 (remove `check_input_*` functions). | Add a check in `assert_input_binary()` that warns when observed values are \"0\"/\"1\" and level order is `c(1, 0)`. Optionally create `as_binary_observed()` helper with a `reference_level` argument for safe factor conversion. | [x] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n81:| 718 | Testing fails locally when done repeatedly | enhancement | 2024-03-20 | bug | low | small | yes | Still relevant and unfixed. Root cause: `cli_warn()` with `.frequency = \"once\"` and `.frequency_id = \"small_interval_range\"` suppresses warnings after first test run in same R session. 4 instances of `.frequency = \"once\"` in codebase. Tests pass on CI (fresh process) and on first local run. | No blocking dependencies. Tangentially related to #935 (surprising output behavior). | Add `rlang::reset_message_verbosity(\"small_interval_range\")` before the `expect_warning()` call in `test-metrics-interval-range.R`. Audit the other 3 `.frequency = \"once\"` sites to ensure their tests are similarly resilient. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n86:| 684 | Delete functions `check_input_sample()`, `check_input_quantile()`, `check_input_interval()` | | 2024-03-06 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant but fully superseded by #939, which covers all 5 `check_input_*` functions. These 3 functions are dead code: never called in production, not exported, only tested. A comment in `check-input-helpers.R` explicitly marks them for future deletion. Should be closed as duplicate of #939. | Superseded by #939. Related to #840 (input check cleanup) and #823 (reduce `try()`). | Close as duplicate of #939. If handled independently, delete the 3 function definitions, their man pages, roxygen cross-references, and corresponding test blocks. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n87:| 668 | Add argument to control what kind of coverage is computed by `get_coverage()` | feature request | 2024-02-29 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant and unimplemented. `get_coverage()` always computes all 4 coverage metrics with no user control. The issue body contains a near-complete code proposal (with a minor bug to fix). The function structure already cleanly separates interval and quantile computation paths. On `scoringutils-2.x` milestone. | No blocking dependencies. Standalone enhancement. | Add a `type = c(\"quantile\", \"interval\")` argument to `get_coverage()` that conditionally computes interval coverage, quantile coverage, or both.

No implementation work done. Function does not exist. Would compute `length(unique(values))` per forecast-unit column (via `get_forecast_unit()`), optionally grouped by model. Similar diagnostic purpose to `get_forecast_counts()` but different output. | Loosely related to #581 (NA in print), #935 (print bug), #621 (closed, prettier print). No hard blockers for standalone function. | Implement a new exported `get_unique_values()` function that takes a forecast object, calls `get_forecast_unit()` to identify relevant columns, and returns a summary table of unique value counts per column. Optionally integrate into `print.forecast()`. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n101:| 492 | Expose `get_range_from_quantile()` to the user | question | 2023-11-22 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. Function exists at `R/helper-quantile-interval-range.R:185` as `@keywords internal`, not exported. Maintainer consensus reached: rename to `get_interval_range()` and create `add_interval_range()` wrapper. Neither implemented. Original motivating function `plot_ranges()` was deleted, reducing urgency. 3 internal call sites. | Parent meta-issue #484. Tangentially related to #885 (export decisions). | Rename `get_range_from_quantile()` to `get_interval_range()`, export it, and create a new exported `add_interval_range()` that adds an `interval_range` column to a quantile-format data.table.

Issue title is outdated. Remaining duplication is between `get_coverage()` (data.table-level) and `interval_coverage()` (numeric scoring metric) — both call `quantile_to_interval()` + bounds check independently. Duplication is small (~5 lines of core logic). | Tracked in meta-issue #459. Related to #668 (coverage type argument). | Update issue title to reference `interval_coverage()`. Refactor `get_coverage()` to delegate interval coverage computation to `interval_coverage()` or a shared internal helper, eliminating duplicated `quantile_to_interval()` + bounds-check pattern. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n108:| 445 | Cleanup: delete calls that use `::` or `:::` and add to imports instead | refactor, implementation-ready | 2023-11-15 | cleanup | low | small | yes | Still relevant. 25 redundant `pkg::fn()` calls across 9 R files where functions are already imported in NAMESPACE (13 data.table, 5 scoringRules, 3 Metrics, 2 cli, 1 purrr, 1 utils). The oft-cited \"64 occurrences\" overstates scope — 37 are roxygen/comment references that should stay. Purely cosmetic cleanup. | None. Standalone cleanup. Tracked in meta-issue #459. | Remove the `pkg::` prefix from 25 redundant function calls across 9 R files. Leave roxygen documentation cross-references and cli-formatting self-references unchanged. | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n112:| 412 | Add check to `validate_forecast()` that predictions must not decrease with quantile | implementation-ready | 2023-11-10 | enhancement | medium | small | yes | Still relevant. Monotonicity check exists only as a hard error deep in `bias_quantile_single_vector()` (R/metrics-quantile.R:495). `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` does NOT check monotonicity — it only validates column presence, quantile range [0,1], and type. `validate_forecast()` was deleted and replaced by `assert_forecast()`. Agreed plan: helper function + warning in `assert_forecast`. No user-facing diagnostic function exists. | Near-duplicate of #895 (user-facing `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` helper). Related to #840 (input check cleanup). | Add monotonicity warning to `assert_forecast.forecast_quantile()` checking that predictions don't decrease with increasing quantile_level. Create a user-facing `get_non_monotonic_forecasts()` helper to identify affected rows (resolving both #412 and #895). | [ ] | [ ] | — | [ ] |\n114:| 406 | Maybe expose `get_type()`. | | 2023-11-10 | enhancement | low | small | yes | Still relevant. `get_type()` (vector type detection: classification/integer/continuous) and `get_forecast_type()` (forecast class type) both exist in `R/get-forecast-type.R` but are internal (`@keywords internal`), not exported. The proposed renames (`get_vector_type`, `get_observed_type`, `get_predicted_type`) were never implemented. No comments, no progress. | Related to #484 (functions to expose) and #885 (export decisions). No blockers. | Rename `get_type()` to `get_vector_type()`, export it, and create `get_observed_type()` / `get_predicted_type()` wrappers that extract the relevant column from a forecast and call `get_vector_type()`.

A pre-v2.0 implementation existed in `check_clean_data()` but was removed during the v2.0 rewrite. A commented-out test skeleton exists in `test-score.R` (lines 51-62). `apply_metrics()` silently overwrites any existing column whose name matches a metric name via `forecast[, (metric_name) := result]`. No pre-scoring clash detection exists. | Tangentially related to #927 (prefix internal columns). Could coordinate with #811 (batch warnings). No blockers. | Add a check after `validate_metrics(metrics)` in each `score.forecast_*` method comparing `names(metrics)` against `colnames(forecast)` and emitting `cli_warn()` on overlap.

No wrapper/adapter functions exist. Users must manually wrap external metrics with non-standard signatures (e.g., reversed arg order, numeric 0/1 instead of factor observed). Two small wrapper proposals in the issue body (`wrap_binary_numeric`, `wrap_switch_order`) were never implemented. The `purrr::partial()` mechanism alone cannot solve argument reordering or type conversion.

No blockers. | Implement 2-3 small exported adapter functions (e.g., `metric_adapt_binary_numeric()` to convert factor to 0/1, `metric_adapt_swap_args()` to reverse observed/predicted order).
