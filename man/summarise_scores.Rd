\usage{
summarise_scores(scores, by = NULL, across = NULL, fun = mean, ...)

summarize_scores(scores, by = NULL, across = NULL, fun = mean, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{A data.table of scores as produced by \code{\link[=score]{score()}}.}

\item{by}{character vector with column names to summarise scores by. Default
is \code{NULL}, meaning that the only summary that takes is place is summarising
over samples or quantiles (in case of quantile-based forecasts), such that
there is one score per forecast as defined by the \emph{unit of a single forecast}
(rather than one score for every sample or quantile).
The \emph{unit of a single forecast} is determined by the columns present in the
input data that do not correspond to a metric produced by \code{\link[=score]{score()}}, which
indicate indicate a grouping of forecasts (for example there may be one
forecast per day, location and model). Adding additional, unrelated, columns
may alter results in an unpredictable way.}

\item{across}{character vector with column names from the vector of variables
that define the \emph{unit of a single forecast} (see above) to summarise scores
across (meaning that the specified columns will be dropped). This is an
alternative to specifying \code{by} directly. If \code{NULL} (default), then \code{by} will
be used or inferred internally if also not specified. Only  one of \code{across}
and \code{by}  may be used at a time.}

\item{fun}{a function used for summarising scores. Default is \code{mean}.}

\item{...}{additional parameters that can be passed to the summary function
provided to \code{fun}. For more information see the documentation of the
respective function.}
}
\value{
a data.table with summarised scores. Scores are summarised according
to the names of the columns of the original data specified in \code{by} or
\code{across} using the \code{fun} passed to \code{summarise_scores()}.
