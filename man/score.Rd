information on how to pass custom arguments to scoring functions.}

}
\value{
An object of class \code{scores}. This object is a data.table with
unsummarised scores (one score per forecast) and has an additional attribute
\code{metrics} with the names of the metrics used for scoring. See
\code{\link[=summarise_scores]{summarise_scores()}}) for information on how to summarise
scores.
}
\description{
\code{score()} applies a selection of scoring metrics to a forecast
object (a data.table with forecasts and observations) (see \code{\link[=as_forecast]{as_forecast()}}).
\code{score()} is a generic that dispatches to different methods depending on the
class of the input data.

See the \emph{Forecast types and input formats} section for more information on
forecast types and input formats.
For additional help and examples, check out the \href{https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/articles/scoringutils.html}{Getting Started Vignette} as
well as the paper \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07090}{Evaluating Forecasts with scoringutils in R}.

\details{
\strong{Customising metrics}

If you want to pass arguments to a scoring function, you need change the
scoring function itself via e.g. \code{\link[purrr:partial]{purrr::partial()}} and pass an updated list
of functions with your custom metric to the \code{metrics} argument in \code{score()}.
For example, to use \code{\link[=interval_coverage]{interval_coverage()}} with \code{interval_range = 90}, you
would define a new function, e.g.
\code{interval_coverage_90 <- purrr::partial(interval_coverage, interval_range = 90)}
and pass this new function to \code{metrics} in \code{score()}.

Note that if you want to pass a variable as an argument, you can
unquote it with \verb{!!} to make sure the value is evaluated only once when the
function is created. Consider the following example:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{custom_arg <- "foo"
print1 <- purrr::partial(print, x = custom_arg)
print2 <- purrr::partial(print, x = !!custom_arg)

custom_arg <- "bar"
print1() # prints 'bar'
print2() # prints 'foo'
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}
\section{Forecast types and input formats}{
Various different forecast types / forecast formats are supported. At the
moment, those are:
\itemize{
\item point forecasts
\item binary forecasts ("soft binary classification")
\item nominal forecasts ("soft classification with multiple unordered classes")
\item Probabilistic forecasts in a quantile-based format (a forecast is
represented as a set of predictive quantiles)
\item Probabilistic forecasts in a sample-based format (a forecast is represented
as a set of predictive samples)
}

Forecast types are determined based on the columns present in the input data.
Here is an overview of the required format for each forecast type:
\if{html}{
  \out{<div style="text-align: left">}
  \figure{required-inputs.png}{options: style="width:750px;max-width:100\%;"}
  \out{</div>}
}
\if{latex}{
  \figure{required-inputs.png}
}

\emph{All forecast types} require a data.frame or similar with columns \code{observed}
\code{predicted}, and \code{model}.

\emph{Point forecasts} require a column \code{observed} of type numeric and a column
\code{predicted} of type numeric.

\emph{Binary forecasts} require a column \code{observed} of type factor with exactly
two levels and a column \code{predicted} of type numeric with probabilities,
corresponding to the probability that \code{observed} is equal to the second
factor level. See details \link[=brier_score]{here} for more information.

\emph{Nominal forecasts} require a column \code{observed} of type factor with N levels,
(where N is the number of possible outcomes), a column \code{predicted} of type
numeric with probabilities (which sum to one across all possible outcomes),
and a column \code{predicted_label} of type factor with N levels, denoting the
outcome for which a probability is given. Forecasts must be complete, i.e.
there must be a probability assigned to every possible outcome.

\emph{Quantile-based forecasts} require a column \code{observed} of type numeric,
a column \code{predicted} of type numeric, and a column \code{quantile_level} of type
numeric with quantile-levels (between 0 and 1).

\emph{Sample-based forecasts} require a column \code{observed} of type numeric,
a column \code{predicted} of type numeric, and a column \code{sample_id} of type
numeric with sample indices.

For more information see the vignettes and the example data
(\link{example_quantile}, \link{example_sample_continuous}, \link{example_sample_discrete},
\code{\link[=example_point]{example_point()}}, \link{example_binary}, and \link{example_nominal}).

\section{Forecast unit}{
In order to score forecasts, \code{scoringutils} needs to know which of the rows
of the data belong together and jointly form a single forecasts. This is
easy e.g. for point forecast, where there is one row per forecast. For
quantile or sample-based forecasts, however, there are multiple rows that
belong to a single forecast.

The \emph{forecast unit} or \emph{unit of a single forecast} is then described by the
combination of columns that uniquely identify a single forecast.
For example, we could have forecasts made by different models in various
locations at different time points, each for several weeks into the future.
The forecast unit could then be described as
\code{forecast_unit = c("model", "location", "forecast_date", "forecast_horizon")}.
\code{scoringutils} automatically tries to determine the unit of a single
forecast. It uses all existing columns for this, which means that no columns
must be present that are unrelated to the forecast unit. As a very simplistic
example, if you had an additional row, "even", that is one if the row number
is even and zero otherwise, then this would mess up scoring as \code{scoringutils}
then thinks that this column was relevant in defining the forecast unit.

In order to avoid issues, we recommend setting the forecast unit explicitly,
usually through the \code{forecast_unit} argument in the \code{\link[=as_forecast]{as_forecast()}}
functions. This will drop unneeded columns, while making sure that all
necessary, 'protected columns' like "predicted" or "observed" are retained.
