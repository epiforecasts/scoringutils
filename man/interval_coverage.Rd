\title{Interval Coverage (For Quantile-Based Forecasts)}
\usage{
interval_coverage_quantile(observed, predicted, quantile, range = 50)

interval_coverage_sample(observed, predicted, range = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{numeric vector of size n with the observed values}

\item{predicted}{numeric nxN matrix of predictive
quantiles, n (number of rows) being the number of forecasts (corresponding
to the number of observed values) and N
(number of columns) the number of quantiles per forecast.
If \code{observed} is just a single number, then predicted can just be a
vector of size N.}

\item{quantile}{vector with quantile levels of size N}

\item{range}{A single number with the range of the prediction interval in
percent (e.g. 50 for a 50\% prediction interval) for which you want to compute
interval coverage.}
}
\value{
A vector of length n with elements either TRUE,
if the observed value is within the corresponding prediction interval, and
FALSE otherwise.
}
\description{
Check whether the observed value is within a given central
prediction interval. The prediction interval is defined by a lower and an
upper bound formed by a pair of predictive quantiles. For example, a 50\%
prediction interval is formed by the 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles of the
predictive distribution.

To compute interval coverage for sample-based forecasts,
predictive samples are converted first into predictive quantiles using the
sample quantiles.
