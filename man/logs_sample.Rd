\title{Logarithmic score (sample-based version)}
\usage{
logs_sample(observed, predicted, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{A vector with observed values of size n}

\item{predicted}{nxN matrix of predictive samples, n (number of rows) being
the number of data points and N (number of columns) the number of Monte
Carlo samples. Alternatively, \code{predicted} can just be a vector of size n.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to
\link[scoringRules:scores_sample_univ]{logs_sample()} from the scoringRules package.}
}
\value{
Vector with scores.
}
\description{
This function is a wrapper around the
\code{\link[scoringRules:scores_sample_univ]{logs_sample()}} function from the
\pkg{scoringRules} package.

The function should be used to score continuous predictions only.
While the Log Score is in theory also applicable
to discrete forecasts, the problem lies in the implementation: The Log score
needs a kernel density estimation, which is not well defined with
integer-valued Monte Carlo Samples. The Log score can be used for specific
discrete probability distributions. See the scoringRules package for
more details.
