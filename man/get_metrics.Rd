\title{Get names of the metrics that were used for scoring}
\usage{
get_metrics(scores, error = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{A data.table with an attribute \code{metrics}.}

\item{error}{Throw an error if there is no attribute called \code{metrics}?
Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
Character vector with the names of the scoring rules that were used
for scoring or \code{NULL} if no scores were computed previously.
}
\description{
When applying a scoring rule via \code{\link[=score]{score()}}, the names of the scoring rules
become column names of the
resulting data.table. In addition, an attribute \code{metrics} will be
added to the output, holding the names of the scores as a vector.

This is done so that functions like \code{\link[=get_forecast_unit]{get_forecast_unit()}} or
\code{\link[=summarise_scores]{summarise_scores()}} can still identify which columns are part of the
forecast unit and which hold a score.

\code{get_metrics()} accesses and returns the \code{metrics} attribute. If there is no
attribute, the function will return \code{NULL} (or, if \code{error = TRUE} will
produce an error instead). In addition, it checks the column names of the
input for consistency with the data stored in the \code{metrics} attribute.

\strong{Handling a missing or inconsistent \code{metrics} attribute}:

If the metrics attribute is missing or is not consistent with the column
names of the data.table, you can either
\itemize{
\item run \code{\link[=score]{score()}} again, specifying names for the scoring rules manually, or
\item add/update the attribute manually using
\code{attr(scores, "metrics") <- c("names", "of", "your", "scores")} (the
order does not matter).
}
