\usage{
ensure_mv_grouping(data, joint_across)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame (or similar) with predicted and observed values.
See the details section of for additional information
on the required input format.}

\item{joint_across}{Character vector with columns names that define the
variables which are forecasted jointly. Conceptually, several univariate
forecasts are pooled together to form a single multivariate forecasts.
For example, if you have a column \code{country} and want to define
a multivariate forecast for several countries at once, you could set
\code{joint_across = "country"}.}
}
\value{
A data.table with a \code{.mv_group_id} column.
}
\description{
Shared helper for multivariate forecast constructors. Applies
\code{\link[=set_grouping]{set_grouping()}} when \code{joint_across} is provided, or checks that
\code{.mv_group_id} already exists.
