\title{Determine dispersion of a probabilistic forecast}
\usage{
mad_sample(observed = NULL, predicted, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{Place holder, argument will be ignored and exists only for
consistency with other scoring functions. The output does not depend on
any observed values.}

\item{predicted}{nxN matrix of predictive samples, n (number of rows) being
the number of data points and N (number of columns) the number of Monte
Carlo samples. Alternatively, \code{predicted} can just be a vector of size n.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \link[stats:mad]{mad()}.}
}
\value{
Vector with dispersion values.
}
\description{
Sharpness is the ability of the model to generate predictions within a
narrow range and dispersion is the lack thereof.
It is a data-independent measure, and is purely a feature
of the forecasts themselves.

Dispersion of predictive samples corresponding to one single observed value is
measured as the normalised median of the absolute deviation from
the median of the predictive samples. For details, see \link[stats:mad]{mad()}
and the explanations given in Funk et al. (2019)

\examples{
predicted <- replicate(200, rpois(n = 30, lambda = 1:30))
mad_sample(predicted = predicted)
