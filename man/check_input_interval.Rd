\title{Check that inputs are correct for interval-based forecast}
\usage{
check_input_interval(observed, lower, upper, range)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{Input to be checked. Should be a numeric vector with the
observed values of size n}

\item{lower}{Input to be checked. Should be a numeric vector of size n that
holds the predicted value for the lower bounds of the prediction intervals.}

\item{upper}{Input to be checked. Should be a numeric vector of size n that
holds the predicted value for the upper bounds of the prediction intervals.}

\item{range}{Input to be checked. Should be a vector of size n that
denotes the interval range in percent. E.g. a value of 50 denotes a
(25\%, 75\%) prediction interval.}
}
\value{
Returns TRUE if the check was successful and a string with an
error message otherwise
}
\description{
Function assesses whether the inputs correspond to the
requirements for scoring interval-based forecasts.
