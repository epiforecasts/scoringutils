\title{Quantile Score}
\usage{
quantile_score(observed, predicted, quantile, weigh = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{A vector with observed values of size n}

\item{predicted}{nxN matrix of predictive samples, n (number of rows) being
the number of data points and N (number of columns) the number of Monte
Carlo samples. Alternatively, \code{predicted} can just be a vector of size n.}

\item{quantile}{vector of size n with the quantile levels of the
corresponding predictions.}

\item{weigh}{if TRUE, weigh the score by alpha / 2, so it can be averaged
into an interval score that, in the limit, corresponds to CRPS. Alpha is the
value that corresponds to the (alpha/2) or (1 - alpha/2) quantiles provided
and will be computed from the quantile. Alpha is the decimal value that
represents how much is outside a central prediction interval (E.g. for a
90 percent central prediction interval, alpha is 0.1). Default: \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
vector with the scoring values
}
\description{
Proper Scoring Rule to score quantile predictions. Smaller values are better.
The quantile score is
closely related to the Interval score (see \code{\link[=wis]{wis()}}) and is
the quantile equivalent that works with single quantiles instead of
central prediction intervals.
}
\examples{
observed <- rnorm(10, mean = 1:10)
alpha <- 0.5

lower <- qnorm(alpha / 2, rnorm(10, mean = 1:10))
upper <- qnorm((1 - alpha / 2), rnorm(10, mean = 1:10))

qs_lower <- quantile_score(observed,
  predicted = lower,
  quantile = alpha / 2
)
qs_upper <- quantile_score(observed,
  predicted = upper,
  quantile = 1 - alpha / 2
)
interval_score <- (qs_lower + qs_upper) / 2
