\usage{
compare_two_models(
  scores,
  name_model1,
  name_model2,
  metric,
  one_sided = FALSE,
  test_type = c("non_parametric", "permutation"),
  n_permutations = 999
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{An object of class \code{scores} (a data.table with
scores and an additional attribute \code{score_names} as produced by \code{\link[=score]{score()}})}

\item{name_model1}{character, name of the first model}

\item{name_model2}{character, name of the model to compare against}

\item{metric}{A string with the name of the metric for which
a relative skill shall be computed. By default this is either "crps",
"wis" or "brier_score" if any of these are available.}

\item{one_sided}{Boolean, default is \code{FALSE}, whether two conduct a one-sided
instead of a two-sided test to determine significance in a pairwise
comparison.}

\item{test_type}{character, either "non_parametric" (the default) or
"permutation". This determines which kind of test shall be conducted to
determine p-values.}

\item{n_permutations}{numeric, the number of permutations for a
permutation test. Default is 999.}
}
\value{
A list with mean score ratios and p-values for the comparison
between two models
}
\description{
This function compares two models based on the subset of forecasts for which
both models have made a prediction. It gets called
from \code{\link[=pairwise_comparison_one_group]{pairwise_comparison_one_group()}}, which handles the
comparison of multiple models on a single set of forecasts (there are no
subsets of forecasts to be distinguished). \code{\link[=pairwise_comparison_one_group]{pairwise_comparison_one_group()}}
in turn gets called from from \code{\link[=pairwise_comparison]{pairwise_comparison()}} which can handle
pairwise comparisons for a set of forecasts with multiple subsets, e.g.
pairwise comparisons for one set of forecasts, but done separately for two
different forecast targets.
