\title{Plot discrimination for binary forecasts}
\usage{
plot_discrimination(forecast)
}
\arguments{
\item{forecast}{A data.table (or data.frame) containing at least columns
\code{observed} (factor with two levels) and \code{predicted} (numeric probabilities
between 0 and 1). Typically a \code{forecast_binary} object or the output of
\code{\link[=as_forecast_binary]{as_forecast_binary()}}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing overlapping density curves of predicted
probabilities, coloured by observed outcome level.
}
\description{
Visualise the discrimination ability of binary forecasts by plotting the
distribution of predicted probabilities, stratified by the observed outcome.
A well-discriminating model will show clearly separated distributions for
the two observed levels.
}
\examples{
library(ggplot2)
plot_discrimination(na.omit(example_binary))

plot_discrimination(na.omit(example_binary)) +
  facet_wrap(~model)
}
