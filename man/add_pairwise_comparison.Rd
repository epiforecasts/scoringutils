\usage{
add_pairwise_comparison(
  scores,
  by = "model",
  metric = intersect(c("wis", "crps", "brier_score"), names(scores)),
  baseline = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{An object of class \code{scores} (a data.table with
scores and an additional attribute \code{metrics} as produced by \code{\link[=score]{score()}})}

\item{by}{character vector with column names that define the grouping level
for the pairwise comparisons. By default (\code{model}), there will be one
relative skill score per model. If, for example,
\code{by = c("model", "location")}. Then you will get a
separate relative skill score for every model in every location. Internally,
the data.table with scores will be split according \code{by} (removing "model"
before splitting) and the pairwise comparisons will be computed separately
for the split data.tables.}

\item{metric}{A string with the name of the metric for which
a relative skill shall be computed. By default this is either "crps",
"wis" or "brier_score" if any of these are available.}

\item{baseline}{A string with the name of a model. If a baseline is
given, then a scaled relative skill with respect to the baseline will be
returned. By default (\code{NULL}), relative skill will not be scaled with
respect to a baseline model.}
}
\description{
Adds a columns with relative skills computed by running
pairwise comparisons on the scores.
For more information on
the computation of relative skill, see \code{\link[=pairwise_comparison]{pairwise_comparison()}}.
Relative skill will be calculated for the aggregation level specified in
\code{by}.
