\usage{
as_forecast_multivariate_point(data, ...)

\method{as_forecast_multivariate_point}{default}(
  data,
  joint_across = NULL,
  forecast_unit = NULL,
  observed = NULL,
  predicted = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame (or similar) with predicted and observed values.
See the details section of for additional information
on the required input format.}

\item{...}{Unused}

\item{joint_across}{Character vector with columns names that define
the variables which are forecasted jointly. Conceptually, several
univariate forecasts are pooled together to form a single
multivariate forecast. For example, if you have a column \code{country}
and want to define a multivariate forecast for several countries
at once, you could set \code{joint_across = "country"}.}

\item{forecast_unit}{(optional) Name of the columns in \code{data} (after
any renaming of columns) that denote the unit of a
single univariate (!) forecast. See \code{\link[=get_forecast_unit]{get_forecast_unit()}} for details.
If \code{NULL} (the default), all columns that are not required columns are
assumed to form the unit of a single forecast. If specified, all columns
that are not part of the forecast unit (or required columns) will be
removed.
Multivariate forecasts are defined by a) specifying the univariate
forecast unit (i.e. the unit of a single forecast if that forecast
were univariate) and b) specifying which variables are pooled together
to form a multivariate forecast.}

\item{observed}{(optional) Name of the column in \code{data} that contains the
observed values. This column will be renamed to "observed".}

\item{predicted}{(optional) Name of the column in \code{data} that contains the
predicted values. This column will be renamed to "predicted".}

\value{
A \code{forecast} object of class \code{forecast_multivariate_point}
}
\description{
Process and validate a data.frame (or similar) or similar with forecasts
and observations. If the input passes all input checks, those functions will
be converted to a \code{forecast} object. A forecast object is a \code{data.table} with
a class \code{forecast} and an additional class that depends on the forecast type.

The arguments \code{observed}, \code{predicted}, etc. make it possible to rename
existing columns of the input data to match the required columns for a
forecast object. Using the argument \code{forecast_unit}, you can specify
the columns that uniquely identify a single forecast (and thereby removing
other, unneeded columns. See section "Forecast Unit" below for details).
}
\section{Target format}{
The input for all further scoring needs to be a data.frame or similar
with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{observed}: Column of type \code{numeric} with observed values.
\item \code{predicted}: Column of type \code{numeric} with predicted values.
\item \code{mv_group_id}: Column of any type with unique identifiers
(unique within a single forecast) for each multivariate group.
This column is created automatically using the \code{forecast_unit}
and the \code{joint_across} arguments.
}

For convenience, we recommend an additional column \code{model} holding
the name of the forecaster or model that produced a prediction, but
this is not strictly necessary.

See the \link{example_point} data set for an example of point forecast data.
}

\section{Forecast unit}{
In order to score forecasts, \code{scoringutils} needs to know which of the rows
of the data belong together and jointly form a single forecast. This is
easy e.g. for point forecast, where there is one row per forecast. For
quantile or sample-based forecasts, however, there are multiple rows that
belong to a single forecast. (For a multivariate forecast, several univariate
forecasts are pooled together to form a joint forecast. In the multivariate
case, "forecast unit" still refers to the forecast unit of the univariate
forecasts that are pooled together to form the multivariate forecast.)

The \emph{forecast unit} or \emph{unit of a single forecast} is then described by the
combination of columns that uniquely identify a single forecast.
For example, we could have forecasts made by different models in various
locations at different time points, each for several weeks into the future.
The forecast unit could then be described as
\code{forecast_unit = c("model", "location", "forecast_date", "forecast_horizon")}.
\code{scoringutils} automatically tries to determine the unit of a single
forecast. It uses all existing columns for this, which means that no columns
must be present that are unrelated to the forecast unit. As a very simplistic
example, if you had an additional row, "even", that is one if the row number
is even and zero otherwise, then this would mess up scoring as \code{scoringutils}
then thinks that this column was relevant in defining the forecast unit.

In order to avoid issues, we recommend setting the forecast unit explicitly,
using the \code{forecast_unit} argument. This will simply drop unneeded columns,
while making sure that all necessary, 'protected columns' like "predicted"
or "observed" are retained.
