\title{Squared error of the mean (sample-based version)}
\usage{
se_mean_sample(observed, predicted)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{A vector with observed values of size n}

\item{predicted}{nxN matrix of predictive samples, n (number of rows) being
the number of data points and N (number of columns) the number of Monte
Carlo samples. Alternatively, \code{predicted} can just be a vector of size n.}
}
\description{
Squared error of the mean calculated as

\deqn{
  \textrm{mean}(\textrm{observed} - \textrm{mean prediction})^2
}{
  mean(observed - mean prediction)^2
}
The mean prediction is calculated as the mean of the predictive samples.
}
\examples{
observed <- rnorm(30, mean = 1:30)
predicted_values <- matrix(rnorm(30, mean = 1:30))
se_mean_sample(observed, predicted_values)
