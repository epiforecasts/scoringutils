\usage{
check_input_sample(observed, predicted)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{Input to be checked. Should be a numeric vector with the
observed values of size n}

\item{predicted}{Input to be checked. Should be a numeric nxN matrix of
predictive samples, n (number of rows) being the number of data points and N
(number of columns) the number of samples per forecast.
If \code{observed} is just a single number, then predicted values can just be a
vector of size N.}
}
\value{
Returns TRUE if the check was successful and a string with an
error message otherwise
}
