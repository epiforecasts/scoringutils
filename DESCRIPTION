Description: 
    `scoringutils` facilitates the evaluation of forecasts in a convenient 
    framework based on `data.table`. It allows user to to check their forecasts 
    and diagnose issues, to visualise forecasts and missing data, to transform 
    data before scoring, to handle missing forecasts, to aggregate scores, and 
    to visualise the results of the evaluation. The package mostly focuses on 
    the evaluation of probabilistic forecasts and allows evaluating several 
    different forecast types and input formats. Find more information about the 
    package in the Vignettes as well as in the accompanying paper 
    (<doi:10.48550/arXiv.2205.07090>).
