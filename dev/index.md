# scoringutils

***Note***: [*This
documentation*](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/dev/) *refers to
the development version of `scoringutils`.* *You can also view the*
[*documentation of the stable
version*](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/).

## Utilities for Scoring and Assessing Predictions

The `scoringutils` package facilitates the process of evaluating
forecasts in R, using a convenient and flexible `data.table`-based
framework. It provides broad functionality to check the input data and
diagnose issues, to visualise forecasts and missing data, to transform
data before scoring, to handle missing forecasts, to aggregate scores,
and to visualise the results of the evaluation. The package is easily
extendable, meaning that users can supply their own scoring rules or
extend existing classes to handle new types of forecasts.

The package underwent a major re-write. The most comprehensive
documentation for the updated package is the [revised
version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1URaMsXmHJ1twpLpMl1sl2HW4lPuUycoj/view?usp=drive_link)
of our [original](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.07090)
`scoringutils` paper.

Another good starting point are the vignettes [Details on the metrics
implemented](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/articles/metric-details.html)
and [Scoring forecasts
directly](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/articles/scoring-forecasts-directly.html).

## Installation

Install the CRAN version of this package using

``` r
install.packages("scoringutils")
```

Install the unstable development version from GitHub using

``` r
remotes::install_github("epiforecasts/scoringutils", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Quick start

### Forecast types

`scoringutils` currently supports scoring the following forecast types:

- `binary`: a probability for a binary (yes/no) outcome variable.
- `point`: a forecast for a continuous or discrete outcome variable that
  is represented by a single number.
- `quantile`: a probabilistic forecast for a continuous or discrete
  outcome variable, with the forecast distribution represented by a set
  of predictive quantiles.
- `sample`: a probabilistic forecast for a continuous or discrete
  outcome variable, with the forecast represented by a finite set of
  samples drawn from the predictive distribution.
- `nominal` categorical forecast with unordered outcome possibilities
  (generalisation of binary forecasts to multiple outcomes)

### Input formats and input validation

The expected input format is generally a `data.frame` (or similar) with
required columns `observed`, and `predicted` that holds the forecasts
and observed values. Exact requirements depend on the forecast type. For
more information, have a look at the
[paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1URaMsXmHJ1twpLpMl1sl2HW4lPuUycoj/view?usp=drive_link),
call
[`?as_forecast_binary`](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/dev/reference/as_forecast_binary.md),
[`?as_forecast_quantile`](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/dev/reference/as_forecast_quantile.md)
etc., or have a look at the example data provided in the package
(`example_binary`, `example_point`, `example_quantile`,
`example_sample_continuous`, `example_sample_discrete`,
`example_nominal`).

Before scoring, input data needs to be validated and transformed into a
forecast object using one of the `as_forecast_<type>()` functions.

``` r
forecast_quantile <- example_quantile |>
  as_forecast_quantile(
    forecast_unit = c(
      "location", "forecast_date", "target_end_date", "target_type", "model", "horizon"
    )
  )
#> ℹ Some rows containing NA values may be removed. This is fine if not
#>   unexpected.

print(forecast_quantile, 2)
#> Forecast type: quantile
#> Forecast unit:
#> location, forecast_date, target_end_date, target_type, model, and horizon

```

### The forecast unit

For quantile-based and sample-based forecasts, a single prediction is
represented by a set of several quantiles (or samples) from the
predictive distribution, i.e. several rows in the input data.
`scoringutils` therefore needs to group rows together that form a single
forecast. `scoringutils` uses all other existing columns in the input
data to achieve this - the values in all other columns should uniquely
identify a single forecast. Additional columns unrelated to the forecast
unit can mess this up. The `forecast_unit` argument in
`as_forecast_<type>()` makes sure that only those columns are retained
which are relevant for defining the unit of a single forecast.

### Scoring forecasts

Forecasts can be scored by calling
[`score()`](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/dev/reference/score.md)
on a validated forecast object.

``` r
scores <- forecast_quantile |> 
  score()
```

[`score()`](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/dev/reference/score.md)
takes an additional argument, `metrics`, with a list of scoring rules.
Every forecast type has a default list of metrics. You can easily add
your own scoring functions, as long as they conform with the format for
that forecast type. See the
[paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1URaMsXmHJ1twpLpMl1sl2HW4lPuUycoj/view?usp=drive_link)
for more information.

You can summarise scores using the function
[`summarise_scores()`](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/dev/reference/summarise_scores.md).
The `by` argument is used to specify the desired level of summary. `fun`
let’s you specify any summary function, although it is recommended to
stick to the mean as a primary summary function, as other functions can
lead to improper scores.

``` r
scores |> 
  summarise_scores(by = c("model", "target_type")) |>
  summarise_scores(by = c("model", "target_type"), fun = signif, digits = 3)
#>                    model target_type     wis overprediction underprediction
#>                   <char>      <char>   <num>          <num>           <num>
