# Determine dispersion of a probabilistic forecast

Sharpness is the ability of the model to generate predictions within a
narrow range and dispersion is the lack thereof. It is a
data-independent measure, and is purely a feature of the forecasts
themselves.

Dispersion of predictive samples corresponding to one single observed
value is measured as the normalised median of the absolute deviation
from the median of the predictive samples. For details, see
[mad()](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/mad.html) and the explanations given in
Funk et al. (2019)

## Usage

``` r
mad_sample(observed = NULL, predicted, ...)
```

## Arguments

- observed:

  Place holder, argument will be ignored and exists only for consistency
  with other scoring functions. The output does not depend on any
  observed values.

- predicted:

  nxN matrix of predictive samples, n (number of rows) being the number
  of data points and N (number of columns) the number of Monte Carlo
  samples. Alternatively, if n = 1, `predicted` can just be a vector of
  size n.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to
  [mad()](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/mad.html).

## Value

Vector with dispersion values.
