# Visualise the number of available forecasts

Visualise Where Forecasts Are Available.

## Usage

``` r
plot_forecast_counts(
  forecast_counts,
  x,
  y = "model",
  x_as_factor = TRUE,
  show_counts = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- forecast_counts:

  A data.table (or similar) with a column `count` holding forecast
  counts, as produced by
  [`get_forecast_counts()`](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/dev/reference/get_forecast_counts.md).

- x:

  Character vector of length one that denotes the name of the column to
  appear on the x-axis of the plot.

- y:

  Character vector of length one that denotes the name of the column to
  appear on the y-axis of the plot. Default is "model".

- x_as_factor:

  Logical (default is `TRUE`). Whether or not to convert the variable on
  the x-axis to a factor. This has an effect e.g. if dates are shown on
  the x-axis.

- show_counts:

  Logical (default is `TRUE`) that indicates whether or not to show the
  actual count numbers on the plot.

## Value

A ggplot object with a plot of forecast counts

## Examples

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr) # pipe operator
forecast_counts <- example_quantile %>%
  as_forecast_quantile %>%
  get_forecast_counts(by = c("model", "target_type", "target_end_date"))
#> â„¹ Some rows containing NA values may be removed. This is fine if not
#>   unexpected.
plot_forecast_counts(
 forecast_counts, x = "target_end_date", show_counts = FALSE
) +
 facet_wrap("target_type")
```
