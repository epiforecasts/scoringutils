# Plot correlation between metrics

Plots a heatmap of correlations between different metrics.

## Usage

``` r
plot_correlations(correlations, digits = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- correlations:

  A data.table of correlations between scores as produced by
  [`get_correlations()`](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/dev/reference/get_correlations.md).

- digits:

  A number indicating how many decimal places the correlations should be
  rounded to. By default (`digits = NULL`) no rounding takes place.

## Value

A ggplot object showing a coloured matrix of correlations between
metrics.

A ggplot object with a visualisation of correlations between metrics

## Examples

``` r
library(magrittr) # pipe operator
scores <- example_quantile %>%
  as_forecast_quantile %>%
  score()
#> â„¹ Some rows containing NA values may be removed. This is fine if not
#>   unexpected.
correlations <- scores %>%
  summarise_scores() %>%
  get_correlations()
plot_correlations(correlations, digits = 2)
```
