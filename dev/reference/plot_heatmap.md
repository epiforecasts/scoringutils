# Create a heatmap of a scoring metric

This function can be used to create a heatmap of one metric across
different groups, e.g. the interval score obtained by several
forecasting models in different locations.

## Usage

``` r
plot_heatmap(scores, y = "model", x, metric)
```

## Arguments

- scores:

  A data.frame of scores based on quantile forecasts as produced by
  [`score()`](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/dev/reference/score.md).

- y:

  The variable from the scores you want to show on the y-Axis. The
  default for this is "model"

- x:

  The variable from the scores you want to show on the x-Axis. This
  could be something like "horizon", or "location"

- metric:

  String, the metric that determines the value and colour shown in the
  tiles of the heatmap.

## Value

A ggplot object showing a heatmap of the desired metric

## Examples

``` r
library(magrittr) # pipe operator
scores <- example_quantile %>%
  as_forecast_quantile %>%
  score()
#> â„¹ Some rows containing NA values may be removed. This is fine if not
#>   unexpected.
scores <- summarise_scores(scores, by = c("model", "target_type"))
scores <- summarise_scores(
  scores, by = c("model", "target_type"),
  fun = signif, digits = 2
)

plot_heatmap(scores, x = "target_type", metric = "bias")
```
