# Plot contributions to the weighted interval score

Visualise the components of the weighted interval score: penalties for
over-prediction, under-prediction and for high dispersion (lack of
sharpness).

## Usage

``` r
plot_wis(scores, x = "model", relative_contributions = FALSE, flip = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- scores:

  A data.table of scores based on quantile forecasts as produced by
  [`score()`](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/dev/reference/score.md)
  and summarised using
  [`summarise_scores()`](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/dev/reference/summarise_scores.md).

- x:

  The variable from the scores you want to show on the x-Axis. Usually
  this will be "model".

- relative_contributions:

  Logical. Show relative contributions instead of absolute
  contributions? Default is `FALSE` and this functionality is not
  available yet.

- flip:

  Boolean (default is `FALSE`), whether or not to flip the axes.

## Value

A ggplot object showing a contributions from the three components of the
weighted interval score.

A ggplot object with a visualisation of the WIS decomposition

## Examples

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr) # pipe operator
scores <- example_quantile %>%
  as_forecast_quantile %>%
  score()
#> â„¹ Some rows containing NA values may be removed. This is fine if not
#>   unexpected.
scores <- summarise_scores(scores, by = c("model", "target_type"))

plot_wis(scores,
  x = "model",
  relative_contributions = TRUE
) +
  facet_wrap(~target_type)

plot_wis(scores,
  x = "model",
  relative_contributions = FALSE
) +
  facet_wrap(~target_type, scales = "free_x")
```
