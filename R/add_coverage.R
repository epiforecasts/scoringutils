#' @title Add Coverage Values to Quantile-Based Forecasts
#'
#' @description Adds interval coverage of central prediction intervals,
#' quantile coverage for predictive quantiles, as well as the deviation between
#' desired and actual coverage to a data.table. Forecasts should be in a
#' quantile format (following the input requirements of `score()`).
#'
#' **Interval coverage**
#'
#' Interval coverage for a given interval range is defined as the proportion of
#' observations that fall within the corresponding central prediction intervals.
#' Central prediction intervals are symmetric around the median and and formed
#' by two quantiles that denote the lower and upper bound. For example, the 50%
#' central prediction interval is the interval between the 0.25 and 0.75
#' quantiles of the predictive distribution.
#'
#' The function `add_coverage()` computes the coverage per central prediction
#' interval, so the interval coverage will always be either `TRUE`
#' (observed value falls within the interval) or `FALSE`  (observed value falls
#' outside the interval). You can summarise the interval coverage values to get
#' the proportion of observations that fall within the central prediction
#' intervals.
#'
#' **Quantile coverage**
#'
#' Quantile coverage for a given quantile is defined as the proportion of
#' observed values that are smaller than the corresponding predictive quantile.
#' For example, the 0.5 quantile coverage is the proportion of observed values
#' that are smaller than the 0.5 quantile of the predictive distribution.
#' Just as above, for a single observation and the quantile of a single
#' predictive distribution, the value will either be `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
#'
#' **Coverage deviation**
#'
#' The coverage deviation is the difference between the desired coverage
#' (can be either interval or quantile coverage) and the
#' actual coverage. For example, if the desired coverage is 90% and the actual
#' coverage is 80%, the coverage deviation is -0.1.
