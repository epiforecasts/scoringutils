#' @title Get Quantile And Interval Coverage Values For Quantile-Based Forecasts
#'
#' @description Compute interval coverage of central prediction intervals,
#' quantile coverage for predictive quantiles, as well as the deviation between
#' desired and actual coverage to a data.table. Forecasts should be in a
#' quantile format (following the input requirements of `score()`).
#'
#' **Interval coverage**
#'
#' Interval coverage for a given interval range is defined as the proportion of
#' observations that fall within the corresponding central prediction intervals.
#' Central prediction intervals are symmetric around the median and formed
#' by two quantiles that denote the lower and upper bound. For example, the 50%
#' central prediction interval is the interval between the 0.25 and 0.75
#' quantiles of the predictive distribution.
#'
#' The function `get_coverage()` computes the coverage per central prediction
#' interval. This means that if you set `by` to the unit of a single forecast,
#' interval coverage will always be either `TRUE`
#' (observed value falls within the interval) or `FALSE` (observed value falls
#' outside the interval) and analogously for quantile coverage.
#' Coverage values become meaningful by summarising them across different
#' dimensions, as specified in the `by` argument (thereby returning the
#' proportion of values covered by all prediction intervals/quantiles).
#'
#' **Quantile coverage**
#'
#' Quantile coverage for a given quantile is defined as the proportion of
#' observed values that are smaller than the corresponding predictive quantile.
#' For example, the 0.5 quantile coverage is the proportion of observed values
#' that are smaller than the 0.5 quantile of the predictive distribution.
#' Just as above, for a single observation and the quantile of a single
#' predictive distribution, the value will either be `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
#'
#' **Coverage deviation**
#'
#' The coverage deviation is the difference between the desired coverage
#' (can be either interval or quantile coverage) and the
#' actual coverage. For example, if the desired coverage is 90% and the actual
#' coverage is 80%, the coverage deviation is -0.1.
#'
#' @inheritParams score
#' @param by character vector that denotes the level of grouping for which the
#' coverage values should be computed. By default (`"model"`), one coverage
#' value per model will be returned.
#' @return a data.table with columns "interval_coverage",
#' "interval_coverage_deviation", "quantile_coverage",
#' "quantile_coverage_deviation" and the columns specified in `by`.
