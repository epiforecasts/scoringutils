#' Metrics for Binary Outcomes
#'
#' @details
#' The functions require users to provide observed values as a factor in order
#' to distinguish its input from the input format required for scoring point
#' forecasts. Internally, however, factors will be converted to numeric values.
#' A factor `observed = factor(c(0, 1, 1, 0, 1)` with two levels (`0` and `1`)
#' would internally be coerced to a numeric vector (in this case this would
#' result in the numeric vector c(1, 2, 2, 1, 1)). After subtracting 1, the
#' resulting vector (`c(0, 1, 1, 0)` in this case) is used for internal
#' calculations. All predictions are assumed represent the probability that the
#' outcome is equal of the highest factor level (in this case that the
#' outcome is equal to 1).
#'
#' You could alternatively also provide a vector like
#' `observed = factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))` (with two levels, `a` and `b`),
#' which would result in exactly the same internal representation. Probabilities
#' then represent the probability that the outcome is equal to "b".
#' If you want your predictions to be probabilities that the outcome is "a",
#' then you could of course make `observed` a factor with levels swapped, i.e.
#' `observed = factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"), levels = c("b", "a"))`
#'
#' @param observed A factor of length n with exactly two levels, holding
#' the observed values.
#' The highest factor level is assumed to be the reference level. This means
#' that `predicted` represents the probability that the observed value is
#' equal to the highest factor level.
#' @param predicted A numeric vector of length n, holding probabilities.
#' Values represent the probability that the corresponding outcome is equal to
#' the highest level of the factor `observed`.
#' @examples
#' observed <- factor(sample(c(0, 1), size = 30, replace = TRUE))
#' predicted <- runif(n = 30, min = 0, max = 1)

#' @description
#' **Brier score**
#'
#' The Brier Score is the mean squared error between the probabilistic
#' prediction and the observed outcome. The Brier score is a proper scoring
#' rule. Small values are better (best is 0, the worst is 1).
#'
#' \deqn{
#'   \textrm{Brier\_Score} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t = 1}^{n} (\textrm{prediction}_t -
#'   \textrm{outcome}_t)^2,
#' }{
#'   Brier_Score = 1/N sum_{t = 1}^{n} (prediction_t - outcome_t)Â²,
#' } where \eqn{\textrm{outcome}_t \in \{0, 1\}}{outcome_t in {0, 1}}, and
#' \eqn{\textrm{prediction}_t \in [0, 1]}{prediction_t in [0, 1]} represents
#' the probability that the outcome is equal to 1.

#' Log Score for Binary outcomes
#'
#' @description
#' **Log score for binary outcomes**
#'
#' The Log Score is the negative logarithm of the probability
#' assigned to the observed value. It is a proper scoring rule. Small values
#' are better (best is zero, worst is infinity).
#'
#' @return A numeric vector of size n with log scores
