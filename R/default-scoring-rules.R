#' @title Scoring Rules for Quantile-Based Forecasts
#' @description Helper function that returns a named list of default

#' The default scoring rules are:

#' - "underprediction" = [underprediction()]
#' - "dispersion" = [dispersion()]

#' - "interval_coverage_deviation" = [interval_coverage_deviation()],

#'
#' Note: The `coverage_90` scoring rule is created as a wrapper around
#' [interval_coverage()], making use of the function [run_safely()].
#' This construct allows the function to deal with arbitrary arguments in `...`,
#' while making sure that only those that [interval_coverage()] can
#' accept get passed on to it. `range = 90` is set in the function definition,
#' as passing an argument `range = 90` to [score()] would mean it would also
#' get passed to `coverage_50`.
