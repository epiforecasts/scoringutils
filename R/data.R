#' Point forecast example data
#'

#' Binary forecast example data
#'
#' A data set with binary predictions for COVID-19 cases and deaths constructed
#' from data submitted to the European Forecast Hub.
#'
#' Predictions in the data set were constructed based on the continuous example
#' data by looking at the number of samples below the mean prediction.
#' The outcome was constructed as whether or not the actually
#' observed value was below or above that mean prediction.
#' This should not be understood as sound statistical practice, but rather
#' as a practical way to create an example data set.
#'
#' The data was created using the script create-example-data.R in the inst/
#' folder (or the top level folder in a compiled package).
#'
#' @format A data frame with the following columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{location}{the country for which a prediction was made}
