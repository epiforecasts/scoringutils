#' @title Probability integral transformation (sample-based version)
#'
#' @description Uses a Probability integral transformation (PIT) (or a
#' randomised PIT for integer forecasts) to
#' assess the calibration of predictive Monte Carlo samples.
#'
#' @details
#' Calibration or reliability of forecasts is the ability of a model to
#' correctly identify its own uncertainty in making predictions. In a model
#' with perfect calibration, the observed data at each time point look as if
#' they came from the predictive proba bility distribution at that time.
#'
#' Equivalently, one can inspect the probability integral transform of the
#' predictive distribution at time t,
#'
#' \deqn{
#' u_t = F_t (x_t)
#' }
#'
#' where \eqn{x_t} is the observed data point at time \eqn{t \textrm{ in } t_1,
#' …, t_n}{t in t_1, …, t_n}, n being the number of forecasts, and \eqn{F_t} is
#' the (continuous) predictive cumulative probability distribution at time t. If
#' the true probability distribution of outcomes at time t is \eqn{G_t} then the
#' forecasts \eqn{F_t} are said to be ideal if \eqn{F_t = G_t} at all times t.
#' In that case, the probabilities \eqn{u_t} are distributed uniformly.
#'
#' In the case of discrete outcomes such as incidence counts,
#' the PIT is no longer uniform even when forecasts are ideal.
#' In that case a randomised PIT can be used instead:
#' \deqn{
#' u_t = P_t(k_t) + v * (P_t(k_t) - P_t(k_t - 1) )
#' }
#'
#' where \eqn{k_t} is the observed count, \eqn{P_t(x)} is the predictive
#' cumulative probability of observing incidence k at time t,
#' \eqn{P_t (-1) = 0} by definition and v is standard uniform and independent
#' of k. If \eqn{P_t} is the true cumulative
#' probability distribution, then \eqn{u_t} is standard uniform.
#'
#' The function checks whether integer or continuous forecasts were provided.
#' It then applies the (randomised) probability integral and tests
#' the values \eqn{u_t} for uniformity using the
#' Anderson-Darling test.
#'
#' As a rule of thumb, there is no evidence to suggest a forecasting model is
#' miscalibrated if the p-value found was greater than a threshold of p >= 0.1,
#' some evidence that it was miscalibrated if 0.01 < p < 0.1, and good
#' evidence that it was miscalibrated if p <= 0.01. However, the AD-p-values
#' may be overly strict and there actual usefulness may be questionable.
#' In this context it should be noted, though, that uniformity of the
#' PIT is a necessary but not sufficient condition of calibration.
#'
#' @param n_replicates The number of draws for the randomised PIT for
#'   discrete predictions. Will be ignored if forecasts are continuous.
#' @inheritParams ae_median_sample
#' @return A vector with PIT-values. For continuous forecasts, the vector will
#'   correspond to the length of `observed`. For integer forecasts, a
#'   randomised PIT will be returned of length
#'   `length(observed) * n_replicates`.
