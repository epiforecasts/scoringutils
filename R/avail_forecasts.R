#' @title Display Number of Forecasts Available
#'
#' @description
#'
#' Given a data set with forecasts, count the number of available forecasts
#' for arbitrary grouping (e.g. the number of forecasts per model, or the
#' number of forecasts per model and location).
#' This is useful to determine whether there are any missing forecasts.
#'
#' @param by character vector or `NULL` (the default) that denotes the
#' categories over which the number of forecasts should be counted.
#' By default (`by = NULL`) this will be the unit of a single forecast (i.e.
#' all available columns (apart from a few "protected" columns such as
#' 'prediction' and 'true value') plus "quantile" or "sample" where present).
#'
#' @param collapse character vector (default is `c("quantile", "sample"`) with
#' names of categories for which the number of rows should be collapsed to one
#' when counting. For example, a single forecast is usually represented by a
#' set of several quantiles or samples and collapsing these to one makes sure
#' that a single forecast only gets counted once.
#'
#' @return A data.table with columns as specified in `by` and an additional
#' column "count" with the number of forecasts. In addition the output has class
#' `scoringutils_available_forecasts` and can e.g. be visualised
#' using [plot()] (which dispatches [plot.scoringutils_available_forecasts()].
