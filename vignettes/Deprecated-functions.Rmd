This Vignette provides a small collection of functions that have been deprecated in `scoringutils`. These functions are no longer, but may still prove useful or illustrative. 

# `merge_pred_and_obs()`

`scoringutils` requires that both forecasts and observations are provided in a single data frame. If you have forecasts and observations in two different data frames, `merge_pred_and_obs()` may help you to merge the two. The function is mostly a wrapper around `merge()`, but does some additional work to deal with duplicated column names.

```{r}
#' @title Merge forecast data and observations
#'
#' @description
#'
#' The function more or less provides a wrapper around `merge` that
#' aims to handle the merging well if additional columns are present
#' in one or both data sets. If in doubt, you should probably merge the
#' data sets manually.
#'
#' @param forecasts A data.frame with the forecast data (as can be passed to
#'   [score()]).
#' @param observations A data.frame with the observations.
#' @param join Character, one of `c("left", "full", "right")`. Determines the
#'   type of the join. Usually, a left join is appropriate, but sometimes you
#'   may want to do a full join to keep dates for which there is a forecast, but
#'   no ground truth data.
#' @param by Character vector that denotes the columns by which to merge. Any
#'   value that is not a column in observations will be removed.
#' @return a data.table with forecasts and observations
#' @importFrom checkmate assert_subset
#' @importFrom data.table as.data.table
#' @keywords data-handling
#' @export
