A variety of metrics and scoring rules can also be accessed directly through 
the `scoringutils` package. 

The following gives an overview of (most of) the implemented metrics. 

# Bias

The function `bias` determines bias from predictive Monte-Carlo samples, 
automatically recognising whether forecasts are continuous or
integer valued. 

For continuous forecasts, Bias is measured as
$$B_t (P_t, x_t) = 1 - 2 \cdot (P_t (x_t))$$

where $P_t$ is the empirical cumulative distribution function of the
prediction for the observed value $x_t$. Computationally, $P_t (x_t)$ is
just calculated as the fraction of predictive samples for $x_t$
that are smaller than $x_t$.

For integer valued forecasts, Bias is measured as

$$B_t (P_t, x_t) = 1 - (P_t (x_t) + P_t (x_t + 1))$$

to adjust for the integer nature of the forecasts. In both cases, Bias can 
assume values between -1 and 1 and is 0 ideally.

```{r}
## integer valued forecasts
observed <- rpois(30, lambda = 1:30)
predicted <- replicate(200, rpois(n = 30, lambda = 1:30))
bias_sample(observed, predicted)

## continuous forecasts
observed <- rnorm(30, mean = 1:30)
predicted <- replicate(200, rnorm(30, mean = 1:30))
bias_sample(observed, predicted)
```


# Sharpness
Sharpness is the ability of the model to generate predictions within a
narrow range. It is a data-independent measure, and is purely a feature
of the forecasts themselves.

Sharpness / dispersion of predictive samples corresponding to one single observed value is
measured as the normalised median of the absolute deviation from
the median of the predictive samples. For details, see `?stats::mad`

```{r}
predicted <- replicate(200, rpois(n = 30, lambda = 1:30))
mad_sample(predicted = predicted)
```

# Calibration

Calibration or reliability of forecasts is the ability of a model to
correctly identify its own uncertainty in making predictions. In a model
with perfect calibration, the observed data at each time point look as if
they came from the predictive probability distribution at that time.

Equivalently, one can inspect the probability integral transform of the
predictive distribution at time t,

$$u_t = F_t (x_t)$$

where $x_t$ is the observed data point at time $t \text{ in } t_1, â€¦, t_n$,
n being the number of forecasts, and $F_t$ is the (continuous) predictive
cumulative probability distribution at time t. If the true probability
distribution of outcomes at time t is $G_t$ then the forecasts $F_t$ are
said to be ideal if $F_t = G_t$ at all times $t$. In that case, the
probabilities ut are distributed uniformly.

In the case of discrete outcomes such as incidence counts,
the PIT is no longer uniform even when forecasts are ideal.
In that case a randomised PIT can be used instead:

$$u_t = P_t(k_t) + v \cdot (P_t(k_t) - P_t(k_t - 1) )$$

where $k_t$ is the observed count, $P_t(x)$ is the predictive
cumulative probability of observing incidence $k$ at time $t$,
$P_t (-1) = 0$ by definition and $v$ is standard uniform and independent
of $k$. If $P_t$ is the true cumulative
probability distribution, then $u_t$ is standard uniform.

The function checks whether integer or continuous forecasts were provided.
It then applies the (randomised) probability integral and tests
the values $u_t$ for uniformity using the
Anderson-Darling test.

As a rule of thumb, there is no evidence to suggest a forecasting model is
miscalibrated if the p-value found was greater than a threshold of $p >= 0.1$,
some evidence that it was miscalibrated if $0.01 < p < 0.1$, and good
evidence that it was miscalibrated if $p <= 0.01$.
In this context it should be noted, though, that uniformity of the
PIT is a necessary but not sufficient condition of calibration. It should
also be noted that the test only works given sufficient samples, otherwise the 
Null hypothesis will often be rejected outright. 


# Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)
Wrapper around the `crps_sample()` function from the
`scoringRules` package. For more information look at the manuals from the
`scoringRules` package. The function can be used for continuous as well as 
integer valued forecasts. Smaller values are better. 

```{r}
observed <- rpois(30, lambda = 1:30)
predicted <- replicate(200, rpois(n = 30, lambda = 1:30))
crps_sample(observed, predicted)
```



# Dawid-Sebastiani Score (DSS)
Wrapper around the `dss_sample()` function from the
`scoringRules` package. For more information look at the manuals from the
`scoringRules` package. The function can be used for continuous as well as 
integer valued forecasts. Smaller values are better. 

```{r}
observed <- rpois(30, lambda = 1:30)
predicted <- replicate(200, rpois(n = 30, lambda = 1:30))
dss_sample(observed, predicted)
```

# Log Score
Wrapper around the `logs_sample()` function from the
`scoringRules` package. For more information look at the manuals from the
`scoringRules` package. The function should not be used for integer valued 
forecasts. While Log Scores are in principle possible for integer valued 
forecasts they require a kernel density estimate which is not well defined 
for discrete values. Smaller values are better. 

```{r}
observed <- rnorm(30, mean = 1:30)
predicted <- replicate(200, rnorm(n = 30, mean = 1:30))
logs_sample(observed, predicted)
```

# Brier Score
The Brier score is a proper score rule that assesses the accuracy of
probabilistic binary predictions. The outcomes can be either 0 or 1,
the predictions must be a probability that the observed outcome will be 1.

The Brier Score is then computed as the mean squared error between the
probabilistic prediction and the observed outcome.

$$\text{Brier_Score} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t = 1}^{n} (\text{prediction}_t - \text{outcome}_t)^2$$


```{r}
observed <- factor(sample(c(0, 1), size = 30, replace = TRUE))
predicted <- runif(n = 30, min = 0, max = 1)

brier_score(observed, predicted)
```

## Interval Score
The Interval Score is a Proper Scoring Rule to score quantile predictions,
following Gneiting and Raftery (2007). Smaller values are better.

The score is computed as

$$ \text{score} = (\text{upper} - \text{lower}) + \\
\frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (\text{lower} - \text{observed}) \cdot 1(\text{observed} < \text{lower}) + \\
\frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (\text{observed} - \text{upper}) \cdot
1(\text{observed} > \text{upper})$$


where $1()$ is the indicator function and $\alpha$ is the decimal value that
indicates how much is outside the prediction interval.
To improve usability, the user is asked to provide an interval range in
percentage terms, i.e. interval_range = 90 (percent) for a 90 percent
prediction interval. Correspondingly, the user would have to provide the
5\% and 95\% quantiles (the corresponding alpha would then be 0.1).
No specific distribution is assumed,
but the range has to be symmetric (i.e you can't use the 0.1 quantile
as the lower bound and the 0.7 quantile as the upper). 
Setting `weigh = TRUE` will weigh the score by $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ such that 
the Interval Score converges to the CRPS for increasing number of quantiles. 


```{r}
observed <- c(1, -15, 22)
predicted <- rbind(
  c(-1, 0, 1, 2, 3),
  c(-2, 1, 2, 2, 4),
  c(-2, 0, 3, 3, 4)
)
quantile <- c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9)

wis(observed, predicted, quantile)
```
