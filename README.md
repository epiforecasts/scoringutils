<!-- badges: end -->

The `scoringutils` package provides a collection of metrics and proper
scoring rules and aims to make it simple to score probabilistic
forecasts against the true observed values.

You can find additional information and examples in the paper
[Evaluating Forecasts with scoringutils in
R](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07090) as well as the Vignettes ([Getting
started](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/articles/getting-started.html),
[Details on the metrics
implemented](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/articles/metric-details.html)
and [Scoring forecasts
directly](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/articles/scoring-forecasts-directly.html)).

The `scoringutils` package offers convenient automated forecast
evaluation in a `data.table` format (using the function `score()`), but
also provides experienced users with a set of reliable lower-level
scoring metrics operating on vectors/matrices they can build upon in
other applications. In addition it implements a wide range of flexible
plots designed to cover many use cases.

Where available `scoringutils` depends on functionality from
`scoringRules` which provides a comprehensive collection of proper
scoring rules for predictive probability distributions represented as
sample or parametric distributions. For some forecast types, such as
quantile forecasts, `scoringutils` also implements additional metrics
for evaluating forecasts. On top of providing an interface to the proper
scoring rules implemented in `scoringRules` and natively, `scoringutils`
also offers utilities for summarising and visualising forecasts and
scores, and to obtain relative scores between models which may be useful
for non-overlapping forecasts and forecasts across scales.

Predictions can be handled in various formats: `scoringutils` can handle
probabilistic forecasts in either a sample based or a quantile based
format. For more detail on the expected input formats please see below.
True values can be integer, continuous or binary, and appropriate scores
for each of these value types are selected automatically.

## Installation

Install the CRAN version of this package using:

``` r
install.packages("scoringutils")
```

Install the stable development version of the package with:

``` r
install.packages("scoringutils", repos = "https://epiforecasts.r-universe.dev")
```

Install the unstable development from GitHub using the following,

``` r
remotes::install_github("epiforecasts/scoringutils", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Quick start

In this quick start guide we explore some of the functionality of the
`scoringutils` package using quantile forecasts from the [ECDC
forecasting hub](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/) as an example. For more
detailed documentation please see the package vignettes, and individual
function documentation.

### Plotting forecasts

As a first step to evaluating the forecasts we visualise them. For the
purposes of this example here we make use of `plot_predictions()` to
filter the available forecasts for a single model, and forecast date.

``` r
example_quantile %>%
  make_NA(what = "truth", 
          target_end_date >= "2021-07-15", 
          target_end_date < "2021-05-22"
  ) %>%
  make_NA(what = "forecast",
          model != "EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble", 
          forecast_date != "2021-06-28"
  ) %>%
  plot_predictions(
    x = "target_end_date",
    by = c("target_type", "location")
  ) +
  facet_wrap(target_type ~ location, ncol = 4, scales = "free") 
```

### Scoring forecasts

Forecasts can be easily and quickly scored using the `score()` function.
This function returns unsummarised scores, which in most cases is not
what the user wants. Here we make use of additional functions from
`scoringutils` to add empirical coverage-levels (`add_coverage()`), and
scores relative to a baseline model (here chosen to be the
EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble model). See the getting started vignette for more
details. Finally we summarise these scores by model and target type.

``` r
example_quantile %>%
  score() %>%
  add_coverage(ranges = c(50, 90), by = c("model", "target_type")) %>%
  summarise_scores(
    by = c("model", "target_type"),
    relative_skill = TRUE,
    baseline = "EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble"
  ) %>%
  summarise_scores(
    fun = signif, 
    digits = 2
  ) %>%
  kable()

#> 1.  144 values for `prediction` are NA in the data provided and the corresponding rows were removed. This may indicate a problem if unexpected.

`scoringutils` contains additional functionality to summarise these
scores at different levels, to visualise them, and to explore the
forecasts themselves. See the package vignettes and function
documentation for more information.
